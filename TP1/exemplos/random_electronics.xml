      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">'''Pribislav''' (died after 1156) was a 12th-century [[prince]] of the West Slavic [[Obotrites]] with his power base in [[Wagria]].

Pribislav was the son of [[Budivoj]]. After the murder of [[Canute Lavard]] in 1131, the Obotrite lands were partitioned between Pribislav and [[Niklot]], with the former receiving Wagria and [[Polabia]] and the latter [[Mecklenburg]] until the [[Peene]] River; Pribislav received the title ''regulus'', or lesser king and resided in [[Liubice]]. A follower of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic paganism]], Pribislav was described by Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair III]], whom he was dependent upon, as an enemy of [[Christianity]] and an [[idolater]].

After the death of Lothair in 1137, Lothair's son-in-law [[Henry the Proud]] and Margrave [[Albert the Bear]] fought over the [[Duchy of Saxony]]. Pribislav took advantage of the struggle to rebel against the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by destroying the new castle of [[Segeburg]] and invading [[Holstein]] in Summer 1138. Saxons from Holstein and [[Stormarn]] under the command of [[Henry of Badewide]] led a massive counterattack the following winter. Another Holsatian campaign in Summer 1139 devastated the Slavic inhabitants of Wagria and placed the territory under German control.

The Slavs under Pribislav's rule were reduced to living in the northeastern corner of Wagria. The prince complained to the Bishop of [[Oldenburg (Holstein)|Oldenburg]] that the taxation and oppression of the Saxon lords were essentially driving the Wagrians to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Slavs retained their old religious practices, such as worship of the god [[Prove (god)|Prove]], near Oldenburg. On Tuesdays Pribislav held court with pagan priests and representatives of the Slavic population. Count [[Adolf II of Holstein]] ultimately won over Pribislav through gifts, and Pribislav converted to Christianity in 1156.

'''Trimethylolpropane phosphite''', C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, is a [[phosphite ester]] used as a [[ligand]] in [[organometallic chemistry]]. Trimethylolpropane phosphite is sometimes abbreviated to EtCage. It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents.

==Ligand in coordination chemistry==
It is prepared by reaction of [[trimethylolpropane]] with [[phosphorus trichloride]] or by [[transesterification]] with [[trimethylphosphite]]:&lt;ref&gt;Verkade, J. G. &quot;Spectroscopic studies of metal-phosphorus bonding in coordination complexes&quot; Coordination Chemistry Reviews 1972, vol. 9, 1-106. {{DOI|10.1016/S0010-8545(00)80224-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:P(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  EtC(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   3 MeOH  +  EtC(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P
The first member of this series was derived from [[trimethylolethane]],&lt;ref&gt;Verkade, J. G.; Reynolds, L. T. &quot;The synthesis of a novel ester of phosphorus and of arsenic&quot; Journal of Organic Chemistry (1960), 25, 663-5. {{DOI|10.1021/jo01074a622}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these derivatives are often poorly soluble.  For this reason, the ethyl derivative has received more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Huttemann, T. J., Jr.; Foxman, B. M.; Sperati, C. R.; Verkade, J. G. &quot;Transition metal complexes of a constrained phosphite ester. IV. Compounds of cobalt(I), cobalt(III), nickel(II), and nickel(0)&quot; Inorganic Chemistry (1965), 4(7), 950-3. {{DOI|10.1021/ic50029a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several EtCage complexes are known, since the ligand is highly basic (for a phosphite) and has a small [[ligand cone angle]] (101°).  Illustrative complexes include [(EtCage)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [Ir&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;(EtCage)] and (CpMe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)RuCl(EtCage)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, shown below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35389">The '''New Brunswick electoral redistribution of 2013''' is being undertaken under the process set out in the ''Electoral Boundaries and Representation Act'' of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]].  The legislation establishes a statutory requirement for [[redistricting|redistribution]] of [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] after every second [[List of post-confederation New Brunswick general elections|New Brunswick general election]].

A commission was struck to draw 49 electoral districts, a decrease from 55 districts, which will first be used in the [[New Brunswick general election, 2014|2014 provincial election]].  The 49 boundaries will have to be within the range of 95% to 105% of the 1/49th of the number of registered voters in the province except in &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot;

Under the legislation, the commission will be chaired by one anglophone and one francophone and consist of 3 to 5 other commissioners, all of whom must be New Brunswick residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnb.ca/0062/acts/acts/e-03-5.htm ''Electoral Boundaries and Representation Act'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative changes==

The ''Electoral Boundaries and Representation Act'' of 2005 set out for a redistribution of 55 ridings after every [[Census of Canada|decennial census]] with ridings within plus or minus 10% of 1/55th of the population.  In Fall 2012, the legislation was amended to reduce the ridings to 49, shift away from census-based population numbers to the number of registered voters, and to make the process occur after every second election (approximately once every 8 years) rather than after each census (once every 10 years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.gnb.ca/legis/bill/editform-e.asp?ID=891&amp;legi=57&amp;num=2 Bill 9, An Act to Amend the Electoral Boundaries and Representation Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission==
The commission was appointed on August 28, 2012 following the unanimous recommendation of a committee of the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2012.08.0789.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are:
*Co-chair: Annise Hollies, former chief electoral officer of New Brunswick
*Co-Chair: [[Allan E. Maher|Allan Maher]], former member of the legislative assembly (1978–1995)
*Member: Conde Grondin, retired professor of political science
*Member: Sue Murray, executive director of Atlantic Provinces Medical Peer Review
*Member: Jean-Guy Rioux, retired teacher and past-president of [[La Federation des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada]]
*Member: James Stanley, a lawyer involved with the [[labour movement]]

==Initial public hearings==
Hearings were held in 13 communities around New Brunswick in October and early November 2012. Following these preliminary hearings, the commission will create a draft proposal for public consideration at a second round of hearings.

==New boundaries==
The commission released a draft map on January 17, 2013 which was open to changes following public consultations held from February 17 to March 6, 2013.  Thereafter, the Commission prepared a final map, released on April 25.  The Commission drew mostly completely new ridings, owing to the fact that they had to reduce the number of ridings by about 10% the tinkering that had been undertaken by previous boundaries commissions was not possible:
:''When a Commission’s mandate is to make little or no change to the total number of ridings, it is both reasonable and practical to begin the work with the existing boundaries and see what if any adjustments should be made. However, the Legislative Assembly has instructed this Commission to draw a map with substantially fewer ridings. In order to meet the requirements of the legislation, the Commission must not simply revise existing boundaries – they must build an entirely new electoral map.''&lt;ref&gt;Electoral Boundaries and Representation Commission. ''[http://www.gnb.ca/elections/boundaries/PED/PDF/report-rapport/Report-Rapport.pdf Preliminary Report]''. January 17, 2013. Accessed: January 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 49 ridings proposed in January were altered only slightly in the final map released on April 25.  The final map may be was reviewed again by the Commission after 23 appeals were filed backed by members of the legislature.  The Commission adopted two name changes, and one minor boundary change affecting 35 voters as a result of the appeals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2013.06.0537.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===New districts===
These districts are almost entirely new, not reflecting any one former district or a merger of the majority of two previous districts.

The old districts transposed into the new districts as follows.

===Largely intact districts===
In these districts, 70% or more of their polling stations continued into a new district.

==Court challenge==
After the release of the map, several Francophone organizations indicated the planned to challenge the law in court.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News. &quot;Francophone groups plan legal challenge over riding law,&quot; July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The court challenge was initially delayed because of mediation between the groups and the provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News. &quot;Electoral boundaries map dispute remains unresolved,&quot; January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mediation broke down without a result satisfactory to the groups, so they filed to challenge the boundaries in court.  Two organizations and two individuals filed a joint suit against the process in general, and specifically including the communities of [[Memramcook]] and [[Neguac]] in majority Anglophone districts.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News. &quot;Francophones challenge electoral boundaries riding map,&quot; April 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having served as [[Ministry of Defence (Guatemala)|defense minister]] in the previous administration, Guevara was victorious in the 7 March [[Guatemalan presidential election, 1982|1982 presidential election]] to succeed outgoing [[President of Guatemala|President]] [[Fernando Romeo Lucas García|Romeo Lucas]], who had hand-picked him as his successor. The election was, however, widely denounced as fraudulent by both [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] groups. A [[Military of Guatemala|military]]-led [[coup d'état]] two weeks after the election prevented Guevara from assuming power and instead installed a three-man [[Military dictatorship|junta]] headed by Gen.

'''Adrien-Marie Legendre''' ({{IPA-fr|adʁiɛ̃ maʁi ləʒɑ̃ːdʁ}}) (18 September 1752 – 10 January 1833) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]. Legendre made numerous contributions to mathematics. Well-known and important concepts such as the [[Legendre polynomials]] and [[Legendre transformation]] are named after him.

== Life ==
Adrien-Marie Legendre was born in Paris on 18 September 1752 to a wealthy family. He  was given an excellent education at the Collège Mazarin in Paris, defending his thesis in physics and mathematics in 1770.  From 1775 to 1780 he taught at the École Militaire in Paris, and from 1795 at the École Normale, and was associated with the Bureau des longitudes.  In 1782, he won the prize offered by the Berlin Academy for his treatise on projectiles in resistant media, which brought him to the attention of [[Lagrange]].

In 1783 he became an adjoint of the Académie des Sciences, and an associé in 1785. In 1789 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://royalsociety.org/dserve/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27le%20gendre%27%29|title = Library and Archive|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the French Revolution, in 1793, he lost his private fortune, but was able to put his affairs in order with the help of his wife, Marguerite-Claudine Couhin, whom he married in the same year. In 1795 he became one of the six members of the mathematics section of the reconstituted Académie des Sciences, named the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts, and later, in 1803, of the Geometry section as reorganized under Napoleon. In 1824, as a result of refusing to vote for the government candidate at the Institut National, Legendre was deprived by the Ministre de L'Intérieur of the ultraroyalist government, the comte de Corbière, of his pension from the École Militaire, where he had served from 1799 to 1815 as mathematics examiner for graduating artillery students. This was partially reinstated with the change in government in 1828 and in 1831 he was made an officer of the [[Légion d'Honneur]].

He died in Paris on 10 January 1833, after a long and painful illness.  Legendre's widow made a cult of his memory, carefully preserving his belongings. Upon her death in 1856, she left their last country house to the village of Auteuil where the couple had lived and are buried.

His name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

== Scientific activity ==
Most of his work was brought to perfection by others: his work on roots of [[polynomial]]s inspired [[Galois theory]]; [[Niels Abel|Abel]]'s work on [[elliptic function]]s was built on Legendre's; some of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]' work in [[statistics]] and [[number theory]] completed that of Legendre. He developed the [[least squares]] method, which has broad application in [[linear regression]], [[signal processing]], statistics, and [[curve fitting]]; this was published in 1806 as an appendix to his book on the paths of comets. Today, the term &quot;least squares method&quot; is used as a direct translation from the [[French language|French]] &quot;méthode des moindres carrés&quot;.

In 1830 he gave a proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] for exponent ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, which was also proven by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Lejeune Dirichlet]] in 1828.

In [[number theory]], he conjectured the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law, subsequently proved by Gauss; in connection to this, the [[Legendre symbol]] is named after him. He also did pioneering work on the distribution of [[prime number|primes]], and on the application of analysis to number theory. His 1798 conjecture of the [[Prime number theorem]] was rigorously proved by [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|de la Vallée-Poussin]] in 1896.

Legendre did an impressive amount of work on [[elliptic function]]s, including the classification of [[elliptic integral]]s, but it took [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]]'s stroke of genius to study the inverses of [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]'s [[Jacobi's elliptic functions|functions]] and solve the problem completely.

He is known for the [[Legendre transformation]], which is used to go from the [[Lagrangian]] to the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulation of [[classical mechanics]]. In [[thermodynamics]] it is also used to obtain the [[enthalpy]] and the [[Helmholtz free energy|Helmholtz]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs]] [[Thermodynamic free energy|(free) energies]] from the [[internal energy]]. He is also the namegiver of the [[Legendre polynomials]], solutions to Legendre's differential equation, which occur frequently in physics and engineering applications, ''e.g.'' [[electrostatics]].

Legendre is best known as the author of ''Éléments de géométrie'', which was published in 1794 and was the leading elementary text on the topic for around 100 years. This text greatly rearranged and simplified many of the propositions from [[Euclid's Elements]] to create a more effective textbook.

==Portrait debacle==
For two centuries, until the recent discovery of the error in 2005, books, paintings and articles have incorrectly shown a [[:File:Louis Legendre.jpg|side-view portrait]] of the obscure French politician [[Louis Legendre]] (1752–1797) as that of the mathematician Legendre. The error arose from the fact that the sketch was labelled simply &quot;Legendre&quot;. The only known portrait of Legendre, recently unearthed, is found in the 1820 book ''Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarellés des membres de I’Institut'', a book of caricatures of seventy-three members of the Institut de France in Paris by the French artist [[Julien-Leopold Boilly]] as shown below:&lt;ref name=Boilly&gt;Boilly, Julien-Leopold. (1820). ''Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarellés des membres de I’Institut'' ([http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.photo.rmn.fr%2Fcf%2Fhtm%2FCSearchZ.aspx%3FE%3D2K1KTS6T7WAMK%26SubE%3D2C6NU00YI4TE&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en watercolor portrait] #29).

'''Lake Elmo''' is a city in [[Washington County, Minnesota|Washington County]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]. The population was 8,069 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&amp;prodType=table|work=American FactFinder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 Census|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the area within the city limits is still [[Arable land|farmland]], so that the city has a rural feel to it.  However, the city density is likely to increase substantially over the next 15 years, due to a new city plan ordered following loss of a lawsuit against the [[Metropolitan Council]], a regional planning authority.

==History==
Lake Elmo, located just southwest of [[Stillwater, Minnesota]], began with one farm in 1852 on the southwest corner of the intersection of what is now Manning Avenue and 30th Street, just southeast of downtown Lake Elmo and across the highway from the [[Lake Elmo Airport]] (FAA LID: 21D). The barn was originally built in 1875 and restored in 1998 as a house. The 1852 farmhouse was intentionally burned down in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stillwatergazette.com/articles/2007/03/27/news/news500.txt |title=Burning down the house |author=Andrew Wallmeyer |publisher=Stillwater Gazette |date=26 March 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Lake Elmo has a City Council that consists of a Mayor and four council members.  The City Council has the legislative authority and determines all matters of policy.  The Mayor and council members are elected to serve a four year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;lakeelmo.org&quot;&gt;http://www.lakeelmo.org/government/city-council&lt;/ref&gt;
The city also has a park commission and a planning commission.  The park commission is there to advise the City Council on issues regarding the development, improvement and maintenance of the city’s parks and trails.  The planning commission is there to make recommendations regarding the Comprehensive Plan and amendments to the plan, site plans, subdivisions, conditional use permits, planning, zoning and sign regulations, open space preservation developments, and other planning related items.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.lakeelmo.org/government/planning-commission&lt;/ref&gt;

The members include:

Mayor – Mike Pearson &lt;ref name=&quot;lakeelmo.org&quot; /&gt;

Council members – Justin Bloyer, Wally Nelson, Mike Reeves, Anne Smith &lt;ref name=&quot;lakeelmo.org&quot; /&gt;

Planning Commission Members – Dean Dodson, Dale Dorschner, Kathy Haggard, Tom Kreimer, Rolf Larson, Jay Morreale, Todd Williams (Chair) &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Park Commission Members – John Ames, Pam Hartley, Sarah Hietpas, Jacob Silvernale, David Steele, Shane Weis (Chair), Mike Zeno &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|24.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|22.25|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minnesota State Highway 36]] runs east–west along Lake Elmo's northern boundary line.  [[Interstate 94]] runs east–west along Lake Elmo's southern boundary line.  [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] serves as a main route, also running east–west.

[http://www.rasmussen.edu/locations/minnesota/twin-cities/lake-elmo-woodbury/ Rasmussen College–Lake Elmo / Woodbury campus] is located in Lake Elmo and serves students in the surrounding areas.  Rasmussen College is a career focused, regionally accredited college that offers bachelor and associate degree programs. Rasmussen college concentrates on programs in the following areas: health sciences, nursing, criminal justice, technology and design, business, and early education.

==Baytown Township Groundwater Plume==
The primary source area for the Baytown Township Groundwater Plume Contamination [[Superfund]] site is a property located at 11325 Stillwater Boulevard in Lake Elmo.  The property was used by a metal-working facility from 1940 to 1968.  The site is listed as a superfund site due to [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]] [[contamination]] of a [[groundwater]] aquifer used for local drinking water supplies.

The '''branch plant economy''' is the phenomenon of [[United States]] companies building factories (branch plants) in [[Canada]], primarily to sell products in the Canadian market.  In the period between the [[American Civil War]] (early 1860s) and [[World War I]], U.S. companies began to look to Canada as a new market.  The branch plants built in Canada were strictly under American rule. Canadian [[tariff]]s on imported products led U.S. companies to build factories in Canada, in effect bypassing the tariffs. 

Some economists are concerned that this phenomenon means that Canada's manufacturing base may be too reliant on outside expertise and resources, and that it may lead to proportionately less [[research and development]] spending in Canada.  Additionally, the degree to which Canadian manufacturing in particular is directed from outside of the country has raised concerns that it is more difficult to direct economic priorities in the interests of Canadians.

An upsurge of [[Canadian nationalism]] in the 1960s and early 1970s led the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] governments of [[Lester Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]] to implement policies aimed at regulating foreign investment. The views of [[Walter L. Gordon]] were especially influential in the 1960s. Further left, [[the Waffle]] emerged in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] on a program based on Canadian economic nationalism and independence. These developments led to measures such as the creation of [[Petro-Canada]], a government-owned oil and gas company, implemented by the Trudeau government in the mid-1970s to increase Canadian control over the oil industry. The [[crown corporation]] was created as one of the demands of the NDP in exchange for their support of Trudeau's minority government. Trudeau also established the [[Foreign Investment Review Agency]] to  regulate foreign investment in the economy and limit the takeover of Canadian-owned companies by foreign [[multinational corporation]]s.

The election of [[Brian Mulroney]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]]  government in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] brought this period of [[economic nationalism]] to an end. Mulroney's government dismantled FIRA and moved to privatize Petro-Canada. The Mulroney government's negotiation and implementation of the [[Canada-US Free Trade Agreement]] resulted in increased economic integration between the US and Canada, and was opposed by economic nationalists in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 election]].

The Canada-US FTA, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] may bring branch plants to an end as the elimination of many tariffs and trade controls makes it much easier for a foreign supplier to sell in the Canadian market without having a branch plant in the country. Numerous plants, particularly in the textile and manufacturing sector, have shut down and moved to [[Mexico]] or other countries with lower wages and costs of production.

The '''Libertarian Party of Indiana''' is the [[Indiana]] affiliate of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. 

==History and Operations==

The founding meeting of the Libertarian Party of Indiana was held on July 14, 1974 at the Holiday Inn at Weir Cook Airport (now called the Indianapolis International Airport). Approximately 20-25 people attended including Paul Hyatt, Tom Duncan, Marvin Lazaro, Brian Bernstein, Dick Smith, Steve Butterbaugh and Charlie Reisert. Reisert made the motion to start the Libertarian Party of Indiana. The first headquarters was located at 1430 N. Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis. The LPIN became a minor political party in 1994 after achieving ballot access when Steve Dillon received more than 2% of the vote running for Secretary of State.

The Libertarian Party of Indiana has continually earned ballot access since 1994. In 2008, the Libertarian presidential ticket of [[Bob Barr]] and [[Wayne Allyn Root]] had their strongest showing in Indiana receiving 1.1% of the vote (19,243 votes)[http://www.lp.org/2008-presidential-results]. On February 17, 2009, [[Indianapolis]] city councilmember Edward Coleman publicly announced that he had left the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party [http://www.ballot-access.org/2009/02/17/indianapolis-city-councilman-switched-from-republican-to-libertarian/] [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-in-libertariancounci,0,2934457.story]. Coleman now is the highest-ranking Libertarian public official in the state, and one of the top (if not highest) ranking [[List of state Libertarian Parties in the United States|Libertarians holding elective office in the United States]]. The party's best finish in a statewide race came in 2006 when [[US Senate]] candidate [[Steve Osborn]] received about 13% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lugar longest serving Ind. congressman&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=79276 | title=Lugar longest serving Ind. congressman | date=January 19, 2011 | accessdate=27 January 2014 | author=Auslen,  Michael | quote=In 2006, he ran against Libertarian Steve Osborn and won by a landslide 87.4 to 12.6 percent victory. The Democratic opponent, Jack Baldwin, was a write-in candidate and received only 294 votes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn had the best result for a third party candidate running for the Senate in the 2006 elections.

The Libertarian Party of Indiana is the only party other than the Democrats and Republicans with ballot access in Indiana. Hoosier Libertarians have continually earned ballot access since 1994. Other parties have tried – and failed, to gain ballot access.  Hoosier Libertarians advocate smaller government while defending civil liberties.  In the last decade, Hoosier Libertarians came to the defense of eminent domain victims, marched in opposition to property tax laws, fought for reduced small business licensing and pursued fairness and transparency in our elections.  Indiana Libertarians lobbied dozens of city and town councils across Indiana to allow property owners to make the decision on smoking on their property.

[[File:DeadSeaIsrael5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Salt deposits beside the [[Dead Sea]]]]
'''Salt''' is a mineral substance composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of [[Salt (chemistry)|ionic salts]]; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or [[halite]]. Salt is present in vast quantities in the [[sea]] where it is the main mineral constituent, with the open ocean having about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of solids per litre, a [[salinity]] of 3.5%. Salt is essential for [[animal]] life, and saltiness is one of the [[Basic tastes|basic human taste]]s. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues; therefore the typical diets of nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds require little or no added salt, whereas cereal-based diets require supplementation. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and [[Salting (food)|salting]] is an important method of [[food preservation]].

Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates back to around 6,000 years ago, when people living in Romania were boiling spring water to extract the salts; a saltworks in China has been found which dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and the Egyptians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara in camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations to go to war over salt and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is also used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.

Salt is produced from salt mines or by the evaporation of seawater or mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are [[caustic soda]] and [[chlorine]], and it is used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other products. Of the annual production of around two hundred million [[tonne]]s of salt, only about 6%  is used for human consumption; other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways and agricultural use.  Edible salt is sold in forms such as [[sea salt]] and table salt which usually contains an [[anti-caking agent]] and may be [[iodised salt|iodised]] to prevent [[iodine deficiency]].  As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods. Too much sodium in the diet raises [[Hypertension|blood pressure]] and may increase the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and [[stroke]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium (5&amp;nbsp;grams of salt) per day.

==History==
{{Main|History of salt}}

[[File:Salzproduktion-Halle.jpg|thumb|Salt production in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] (1670)]]
While people have used [[canning]] and artificial [[refrigeration]] to preserve food for the last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years.{{sfn|Barber|1999|p=136}} A very ancient saltworks operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in [[Vânători-Neamţ|Lunca]], [[Neamț County]], Romania.

{{main|Sodium chloride}}
Salt, sodium chloride, is an [[ionic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NaCl, representing equal proportions of [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The [[molar mass]] of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801&amp;nbsp;°C (1,474&amp;nbsp;°F) and its boiling point 1,465&amp;nbsp;°C (2,669&amp;nbsp;°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions and the solubility is 359 grams per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |title=Salt (NaCl) |author=Wood, Frank Osborne; Ralston, Robert H. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the [[water of hydration|dihydrate]] NaCl·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the [[freezing point]] is −21.12&amp;nbsp;°C (−6.02&amp;nbsp;°F) for 23.31&amp;nbsp;wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7&amp;nbsp;°C (227.7&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=u1&gt;Elvers, B.

==Edible salt==
Salt is essential to the health of people and animals and is used universally as a seasoning. It is used in cooking, is added to manufactured foodstuffs and is often present on the table at mealtimes for individuals to sprinkle on their own food. Saltiness is one of the five basic taste sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/Taste.html |title=The sense of taste |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortified table salt===
Some table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. [[Iodine]] is an important micronutrient for humans, and a [[iodine deficiency|deficiency]] of the element can cause lowered production of [[thyroxine]] ([[hypothyroidism]]) and enlargement of the thyroid gland ([[endemic goitre]]) in adults or [[cretinism]] in children.{{sfn|Vaidya|Chakera|Pearce|2011}} [[Iodized salt]] has been used to correct these conditions since 1924{{sfn|Markel|1987}} and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of [[potassium iodide]], [[sodium iodide]] or [[sodium iodate]]. A small amount of [[dextrose]] may also be added to stabilize the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/food-safety/food-preservation/faq/canning-and-pickling-salt |title=Canning and Pickling salt |publisher=Penn State University}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/food-salt-faqs|publisher = Morton Salt |title=FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of [[mental retardation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcneil&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html |title=In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt|last=McNeil|first=Donald G.

The amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommends [21 CFR 101.9 (c)(8)(iv)] 150 [[micrograms]] of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10–22 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion Paper on the setting of maximum and minimum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/documents/akj_en.pdf|publisher=Directorate-General Health &amp; Consumers |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium ferrocyanide]], also known as yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansard.millbanksystems.com&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|European Commission|2001|p=3}} Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morton Salt FAQ |url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/general-company-faqs#q3 |accessdate =12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the [[Committee on Toxicity]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansard.millbanksystems.com&quot;&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/may/05/table-salt Discussions of the safety of sodium hexaferrocyanate in table salt].

Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other anticaking agents sometimes used include [[tricalcium phosphate]], [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or magnesium carbonates, [[fatty acid]] salts ([[acid salt]]s), [[magnesium oxide]], [[silicon dioxide]], [[calcium silicate]], sodium aluminosilicate and [[calcium aluminosilicate]]. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of [[aluminium]] in the latter two compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Wilella Daniels | last1=Burgess | first2=April C. | last2=Mason | url=http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/HE/HE-625.html | title=What Are All Those Chemicals in My Food? | publisher=School of Consumer and Family Sciences, Purdue University | accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;doubly fortified salt&quot;, both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates [[iron deficiency anaemia]], which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is [[Iron(II) fumarate|ferrous fumarate]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}} Another additive, especially important for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, is [[folic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), which gives the table salt a yellow color. Folic acid helps prevent [[neural tube defect]]s and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

A lack of [[fluorine]] in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of [[dental caries]].{{sfn|Selwitz|Ismail|Pitts|2007}} [[Fluoride]] salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where [[water fluoridation]] is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added [[sodium fluoride]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

===Other kinds===
[[File:Sea Salt.jpg|thumb|left|Irregular crystals of sea salt]]
Unrefined [[sea salt]] contains small amounts of [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[halides]] and [[sulphate]]s, traces of [[algae|algal products]], salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt [[hygroscopic]] (i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered). Algal products contribute a mildly &quot;fishy&quot; or &quot;sea-air&quot; odour, the latter from [[Organobromine compound#Organobromine compounds in nature|organobromine compounds]]. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance. Since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavours would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients.{{sfn|McGee|2004|p=642}} The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough [[iodine]] salts to prevent [[Iodine deficiency|iodine deficiency diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=References on food salt &amp; health issues|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Articles-references/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-food-salt-health-issues|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different natural salts have different [[Minerality#I–P|mineralities]] depending on their source, giving each one a unique flavour. [[Fleur de sel]], a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a unique flavour varying with the region from which it is produced. In traditional [[Korean cuisine]], so-called &quot;[[Jukyeom|bamboo salt]]&quot; is prepared by roasting salt{{sfn|Livingston|2005|p=45}} in a [[bamboo]] container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the [[clastogen|anticlastogenic]] and [[mutagen|antimutagenic]] properties of [[doenjang]] (a fermented  bean paste).{{sfn|Shahidi|Shi|Ho|2005|p=575}}

[[Kosher salt]], though refined, contains no iodine and has a much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing [[kosher meat]]. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet [[kosher]] requirements by a [[hechsher]], but this is not true for all products labelled as kosher salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

===Salt in food===
Salt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing and is also present at higher levels in preserved foods. Thus [[herring]] contains 67&amp;nbsp;mg sodium per 100&amp;nbsp;g, while [[kipper]], its preserved form, contains 990&amp;nbsp;mg. Similarly, [[pork]] typically contains 63&amp;nbsp;mg while [[bacon]] contains 1480&amp;nbsp;mg, and [[potato]]es contain 7&amp;nbsp;mg but [[potato crisp]]s 800&amp;nbsp;mg per 100 g.&lt;ref name=HMSO/&gt; The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.&lt;ref name=HMSO&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual of Nutrition |last=Buss |first=David |last2=Robertson |first2=Jean |year=1973 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |isbn=0112411126 |pages=37–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2001/0729/taste.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=The Salt of Southeast Asia | accessdate=7 July 2011 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, condiments such as [[soy sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and [[oyster sauce]] tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diet.com/g/asian-diet |title=Asian diet |publisher=Diet.com |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 6% of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maldonsalt.co.uk/About-Salt-The-many-uses-of-Salt.html |title=The many uses of salt |publisher=Maldon Salt Company |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sodium chloride is one of the largest inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are [[caustic soda]] and [[chlorine]], which are separated by the [[electrolysis]] of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of [[PVC]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production of [[aluminium]]. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of [[soap]]s and [[glycerine]], where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the [[Saponification|saponified]] products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of [[synthetic rubber]], and another use is in the firing of [[pottery]], when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]].&lt;ref name=WASG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wasalt.com.au/SaltUses.html |title=Salt uses |publisher=WA Salt Group |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the boring mud to provide a stable &quot;wall&quot; to prevent the hole collapsing. There are many other processes in which salt is involved. These include its use as a [[mordant]] in [[textile]] dying, to regenerate [[resin]]s in water softening, for the [[tanning]] of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the [[canning]] of meat and vegetables.&lt;ref name=WASG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihs.com/products/chemical/planning/ceh/sodium-chloride.aspx |title=Sodium chloride |date=1 December 2008 |publisher=IHS Chemical |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kostick|2011}}

The manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salt.org.il/arch.html | title=Salt made the world go round | work=Salt.org.il | date=1 September 1997 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of salt is seawater, which has a [[salinity]] of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of [[sea salt|dissolved salts]], predominantly [[sodium]] ({{chem|Na||+}}) and [[chloride]] ({{chem|Cl||-}}) [[ions]], per kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lbs) of water.{{sfn|Millero|Feistel|Wright|McDougall|2008}} The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated.&lt;ref name=IHS/&gt; The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. [[Salt evaporation pond]]s are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/earthobservatory/SALT_PONDS,SOUTH_SAN_FRANCISCO_BAY.HTM |title=Salt Ponds, South San Francisco Bay |work=Earth Observatory Newsroom |publisher=NASA |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either [[salt mine|mined]] directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in [[Open pan salt making|shallow open pans]] which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under [[vacuum]].{{sfn|Kostick|2011}} The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are [[kiln]]-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090409144219/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/aboutsalt-prod02.htm About salt: Production]. The Salt Manufacturers Association&lt;/ref&gt; Some salt is produced using the [[Alberger process]], which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12642/Alberger-process |title=Alberger process |work=Manufacture of salt: Uses of artificial heat |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreo]], an indigenous group from the Paraguayan [[Gran Chaco people|Chaco]], obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (''Maytenus vitis-idaea'') and other trees.{{sfn|Schmeda-Hirschmann|1994}}

One of the largest [[salt mining]] operations in the world is at the [[Khewra Salt Mine]] in Pakistan. The mine has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} of passages. The salt is dug out by the [[room and pillar]] method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of [[Himalayan salt]] is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Seattle Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Pennington |first=Matthew |title=Pakistan salt mined old-fashioned way mine|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002159747_saltmine25.html |accessdate=11 October 2013 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, total world production (of sodium chloride in general, not just table salt) was estimated at 210 million [[tonne]]s, the top five producers being the United States (40.3 million tonnes), China (32.9), Germany (17.7), India (14.5) and Canada (12.3).{{sfn|Feldman|2005}} During the period 2003 to 2008, global production of salt increased by 12% per year, and China took over as the largest producing nation as its chemical industry expanded.&lt;ref name=IHS/&gt; Food grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] (7% in Europe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eusalt.com/pages/salt-applications/food-animal.html | title=Food Grade Salt | publisher=European Salt Producers' Association | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of salt production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roskill.com/reports/salt | title=Roskill Information Services | publisher=Roskill.com | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in religion==
[[File:Russian bread and salt.jpg|thumb|[[Bread and salt]] at a Russian wedding ceremony]]
Salt has long held an important place in religion and culture.

'''Water''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''{{chem|H|2|O}}'''. A [[Properties of water|water molecule]] contains one [[oxygen]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s that are connected by [[covalent bond]]s. Water is a [[liquid]] at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]], but it often co-exists on [[Earth]] with its [[solid]] state, [[ice]], and [[gas]]eous state, [[steam]] ([[water vapor]]).

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=CIA - The world factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is vital for all known forms of [[Life#Range of tolerance|life]].  On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], [[cloud]]s (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book|title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources|editor=Gleick, P.H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|page=13, Table 2.1 &quot;Water reserves on the earth&quot;|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, Special Report, [AGU], December 1995 (linked 4/2007).

Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Water on Earth moves continually through the [[water cycle]] of [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]] ([[evapotranspiration]]), [[condensation]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[Surface runoff|runoff]], usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Water used in the production of a good or service is known as [[virtual water]].

Safe [[drinking water]] is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no [[Food energy|calories]] or [[Organic compound|organic]] [[nutrient]]s. Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN/&gt; There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and [[gross domestic product per capita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gapminder.org/videos/gapcasts/gapcast-9-public-services/ &quot;Public Services&quot;], Gapminder video&lt;/ref&gt; However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the [[world population]] will be facing water-based vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kulshreshtha, S.N|year=1998|title=A Global Outlook for Water Resources to the Year 2025|journal=Water Resources Management|volume=12|issue=3|pages=167–184|doi=10.1023/A:1007957229865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/Water/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Full_Report_001.pdf|title=Charting Our Water Future: Economic frameworks to inform decision-making|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water plays an important role in the [[world economy]], as it functions as a [[solvent]] for a wide variety of chemical substances and facilitates industrial cooling and transportation.

Water is the [[chemical substance]] with [[chemical formula]] {{chem|H|2|O}}: one [[molecule]] of water has two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s [[covalent]]ly [[chemical bond|bonded]] to a single [[oxygen]] atom.

Water appears in nature in all three common states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) and may take many different forms on Earth: water vapor and [[cloud]]s in the sky, [[seawater]] in the oceans, [[iceberg]]s in the polar oceans, [[glacier]]s in the [[mountain]]s, fresh and salt water [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, and [[aquifer]]s in the ground.

The major chemical and physical properties of water are:

*Water is a liquid at [[standard conditions|standard temperature and pressure]]. It is tasteless and odorless. The intrinsic [[colour of water]] and ice is a very slight blue hue, although both appear colorless in small quantities. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braun|first=Charles L.|coauthors=Sergei N. Smirnov|title=Why is water blue?|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|volume=70|issue=8|page=612|year=1993|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm|doi=10.1021/ed070p612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Water is [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] in the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Thus [[aquatic plant]]s can live in water because [[sunlight]] can reach them. Infrared light is strongly [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by the hydrogen-oxygen or OH bonds.

*Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen atoms, the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. As a result, water is a [[polar molecule]] with an [[electrical dipole moment]]. Water also can form an unusually large number of intermolecular [[hydrogen bonds]] (four) for a molecule of its size. These factors lead to strong attractive forces between molecules of water, giving rise to water's high [[surface tension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil A.|coauthors=Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden|title=Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and capillary forces. The [[capillary action]] refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of [[gravity]]. This property is relied upon by all [[vascular plant]]s, such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html Capillary Action&amp;nbsp;– Liquid, Water, Force, and Surface – JRank Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Water is a good polar [[solvent]] and is often referred to as ''the universal [[solvent]]''. Substances that dissolve in water, e.g., [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[sugar]]s, [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]s, and some [[gas]]es – especially oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]] ([[carbonation]]) – are known as ''[[hydrophilic]]'' (water-loving) substances, while those that are [[Miscibility|immiscible]] with water (e.g., [[lipids|fats and oils]]), are known as ''[[hydrophobic]]'' (water-fearing) substances.

*All of the components in cells ([[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s) are dissolved in water, deriving their structure and activity from their interactions with the water.

*Pure water has a low [[electrical conductivity]], but this increases with the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of a small amount of ionic material such as [[sodium chloride]].

*The [[boiling point]] of water (and all other liquids) is dependent on the [[barometric pressure]]. For example, on the top of [[Mt. Everest]] water boils at {{convert|68|°C}}, compared to {{convert|100|°C}} at [[sea level]] at a similar latitude (since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly). Conversely, water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid.
*At 4181.3 J/(kg·K), water has a high [[specific heat capacity]], as well as a high [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|40.65 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), both of which are a result of the extensive [[hydrogen bonding]] between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth's [[climate]] by buffering large fluctuations in temperature.

*The [[density]] of liquid water is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}} at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Ice has a density of {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.
[[File:Label for dangerous goods - class 4.3.svg|right|thumb|[[European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road|ADR]] [[Dangerous goods|label]] for transporting goods dangerously reactive with water]]

*The maximum [[density]] of water occurs at {{convert|3.98|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kotz, J. C., Treichel, P., &amp; Weaver, G. C.|year=2005|title=Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole|isbn=0-534-39597-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most known pure substances become more dense as they cool, however water has the anomalous property of becoming less dense when it is cooled to its solid form, ice. During cooling water becomes more dense until reaching 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C. Below this temperature, the open structure of ice is gradually formed in the low temperature water; the random orientations of the water molecules in the liquid are maintained by the thermal motion, and below 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C there is not enough thermal energy to maintain this randomness. As water is cooled there are two competing effects: 1) decreasing volume, and 2) increase overall volume of the liquid as the molecules begin to orient into the organized structure of ice. Between 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C and 0&amp;nbsp;°C, the second effect will cancel the first effect so the net effect is an increase of volume with decreasing temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ben-Naim et al.|first=Ariel|title= Alice's Adventures in Water-land
|year=2011|location= Singapore|doi=10.1142/8068|last2=Ben-Naim|first2=Roberta|isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water expands to occupy a 9% greater volume as ice, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water, as in [[icebergs]].

*Water is [[miscible]] with many liquids, such as [[ethanol]], in all proportions, forming a single [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] liquid. On the other hand, water and most [[oil]]s are immiscible, usually forming layers with the least dense liquid as the top layer, and the most dense layer at the bottom.

*Water forms an [[azeotrope]] with many other solvents.

*Water can be [[Electrolysis of water|split by electrolysis]] into hydrogen and oxygen.

*As an oxide of hydrogen, water is formed when hydrogen or hydrogen-containing compounds [[Combustion|burn]] or [[Chemical reaction|react]] with oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds. Water is not a [[fuel]], it is an end-product of the combustion of hydrogen. The [[energy]] required to split water into hydrogen and oxygen by [[electrolysis]] or any other means is greater than the energy that can be collected when the hydrogen and oxygen recombine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ball|title=Burning water and other myths|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] News|date=14 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chemical element|Elements]] which are more [[Electropositivity|electropositive]] than hydrogen such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]] and [[caesium]] displace hydrogen from water, forming [[hydroxide]]s. Being a flammable gas, the hydrogen given off is dangerous and the reaction of water with the more electropositive of these elements may be violently explosive.

==Taste and odor==
Pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is tasteless and odorless.

Water can dissolve many different substances, giving it varying tastes and odors. [[Humans]], and other animals, have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the [[drinking water|potability]] of water by avoiding water that is too salty or [[putrid]].

The taste of [[spring water]] and [[mineral water]], often advertised in marketing of consumer products, derives from the minerals dissolved in it. The advertised purity of spring and mineral water refers to absence of [[toxin]]s, [[pollutant]]s, and [[microorganism|microbes]], not to the absence of naturally occurring minerals.

==Distribution in nature==

===In the universe===
Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of [[star formation]]. When stars are born, their birth is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, Gary, [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and Neufeld, David, [[Johns Hopkins University]] quoted in:

On 22 July 2011 a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing &quot;140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined&quot; around a [[quasar]] located 12 billion light years from Earth.

Water has been detected in [[interstellar cloud]]s within our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].{{fact|date=March 2014}} Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe.{{fact|date=March 2014}} Based on models of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] and that of other star systems, most other [[planetary system]]s are likely to have similar ingredients.

Water and other [[volatiles]] probably comprise much of the internal structures of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of [[ionic water]] in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down as [[superionic water]] in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html Weird water lurking inside giant planets], ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and habitable zone===
{{Further|Water distribution on Earth}}
The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its [[gas]]eous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of [[Organism|life on Earth]] as we know it. The Earth is located in the [[habitable zone]] of the [[solar system]]; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the [[Sun]] (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=J. C. I. Dooge. &quot;Integrated Management of Water Resources&quot;|editor=Ehlers, E.; Krafft, T|title=Understanding the Earth System: compartments, processes, and interactions|publisher=Springer|year=2001|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habitable Zone|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/habzone.html|work=The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy and Spaceflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's [[gravity]] allows it to hold an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer ([[greenhouse effect]]) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in [[polar ice cap]]s (as on [[Mars]]).

The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through [[geologic time]] despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ([[insolation]]), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric [[albedo]]. This proposal is known as the ''[[Gaia hypothesis]]''.

The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets [[Gliese 436 b]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=New Scientist|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html|title=Strange alien world made of &quot;hot ice&quot;|date=6 May 2007|first=David|last=Shiga|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GJ 1214 b]].&lt;ref&gt;

==On Earth==

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Water Distribution.jpg|thumb|Graphical illustration of the Earth's relative water distribution at various locations on or near its surface&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Garrison|title =Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science (7th Edition)|publisher =Yolanda Cossio|year =2009|page=|isbn =978-0495391937}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface; the oceans contain 96.5% of the Earth's water. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as [[cloud]]s, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].

The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1,338,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (321,000,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Liquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, [[sea]], [[lake]], [[river]], [[stream]], [[canal]], [[pond]], or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.

Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].

===Water cycle===
{{Main|Water cycle}}
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]

The [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the '''hydrologic cycle''') refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and [[plant]]s.

Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of following transfer processes:
*[[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into air.
*[[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
*[[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the [[sea]].
Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&amp;nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&amp;nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly [[rain]], [[snow]], and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources|editor=Gleick, P.H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|page=15, Table 2.3|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when
the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land
|author =Ben-Naim, A. and Ben-Naim, R., P.H.|publisher=World Scientific Publishing |year=2011|page= 31|doi=10.1142/8068|isbn =978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensed water in the air may also [[refract]] [[sunlight]] to produce [[rainbow]]s.

Water runoff often collects over [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for [[travel]] and [[commerce]]. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A [[flood]] occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A [[drought]] is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.

===Fresh water storage===
{{imageframe
|width=400
|content=[[File:Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg|200px]][[File:Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg|200px]]
|caption=The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide (left) and low tide (right)
}}
{{Main|Water resources}}
Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes.
At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow pack and glaciers.
Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], or more spectacularly in [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in [[water well|wells]].
This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.

===Sea water===
{{Main|Seawater}}
[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride|salt]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about −1.9 °C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]].

===Tides===
{{Main|Tide}}
[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams.
The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.

==Effects on life==
[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with [[vegetation]] in a [[desert]].]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/span&gt;]] and [[cellular respiration|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;respiration&lt;/span&gt;]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]
From a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of [[life]] that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.

Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.

===Aquatic life forms===
{{Main|Hydrobiology|Aquatic plant}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s – a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]
Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all [[fish]] live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].

Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water.

==Effects on human civilization==
[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]
Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Shanghai]], [[Tokyo]], [[Chicago]], and [[Hong Kong]] owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like [[Singapore]], have flourished for the same reason. In places such as [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.

===Health and pollution===
[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program - a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or [[potable water]]. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].

Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or &quot;safe for bathing&quot;. Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.

In the USA, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, [[shower]]s and [[kitchen]] runoff, but not [[toilet]]s, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.

This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and [[sanitation]] during the [[29th G8 summit|2003 G8 Evian summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html|title=G8 &quot;Action plan&quot; decided upon at the 2003 Evian summit|publisher=G8.fr|date=2003-06-02|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/|title=World Health Organization. Safe Water and Global Health|publisher=Who.int|date=2008-06-25|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, however, is not a finite resource, but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation in quantities many degrees of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking [[water supply]], which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years), that is a [[non-renewable resource]], and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce, rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption), since the manufacturing process uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.

In the developing world, 90% of all [[wastewater]] still goes untreated into local rivers and streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmentally Sound Technology for Wastewater and Stormwater Management: An International Source Book|author=UNEP International Environment|year=2002|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=1-84339-008-6|oclc=49204666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate Change and Developing Countries|last=Ravindranath|first=Nijavalli H.|coauthors=Jayant A. Sathaye|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-0104-5|oclc=231965991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.

====Agriculture====
[[File:Subsurface drip emission on loamy soil.ogv|thumb|Water distribution in subsurface [[drip irrigation]]]]
[[File:SiphonTubes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] of field crops]]
The most important use of water in [[agriculture]] is for [[irrigation]], which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA|title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Water Use in the United States&quot;&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At this time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleick|first=P.H.|title=Peak Water|url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf|accessdate=2011-10-11|year=2010|publisher=[[National Academy of Science]]|doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107|journal=Proceedings National Academy of Science|volume=107|issue=125|pages=11155–11162|last2=Palaniappan|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from [[industry]], [[urbanisation]] and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Press Release POP/952, 13 March 2007. [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm World population will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050]&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the [[International Water Management Institute]] in [[Sri Lanka]] to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a scientific standard====
On 7 April 1795, the [[gram]] was defined in [[France]] to be equal to &quot;the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Décret relatif aux poids et aux mesures. 18 germinal an 3 (7 April 1795)]. Decree relating to the weights and measurements (in French). quartier-rural.org&lt;/ref&gt; For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the [[kilogram]]. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one [[litre|liter]] of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at 0&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;— a highly reproducible ''temperature''&amp;nbsp;— the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water ''density'', which was measured at the time as {{convert|4|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm here L'Histoire Du Mètre, La Détermination De L'Unité De Poids]. histoire.du.metre.free.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kelvin temperature scale]] of the SI system is based on the [[triple point]] of water, defined as exactly 273.16&amp;nbsp;K or 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C. The scale is an [[absolute temperature]] scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according the [[boiling point]] (set to 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[melting point]] (set to 0&amp;nbsp;°C) of water.

Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]). The amount of deuterium oxides or [[heavy water]] is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] specification.

[[File:2006 Global Water Availability.svg|thumb|right|Water availability: fraction of population using improved water sources by country]]
The [[human body]] contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-05/958588306.An.r.html Re: What percentage of the human body is composed of water?] Jeffrey Utz, M.D., The MadSci Network&lt;/ref&gt; To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per [[day]] to avoid [[dehydration]]; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/healthy_living/nutrition/drinks_water.shtml|title=Healthy Water Living|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.&lt;ref name=Rhoades_2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhoades RA, Tanner GA|title=Medical Physiology|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|edition=2nd|location=Baltimore|year=2003|isbn=0-7817-1936-4|oclc=50554808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of [[water intoxication]] (hyperhydration), which can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Noakes TD, Goodwin N, Rayner BL, ''et al.''|title=Water intoxication: a possible complication during endurance exercise|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|year=1985|volume=17|issue=3|pages=370–375|pmid=4021781|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1985/06000/Water_intoxication__a_possible_complication_during.12.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Noakes TD, Goodwin N, Rayner BL, Branken T, Taylor RK|title=Water intoxication: a possible complication during endurance exercise, 1985|journal=Wilderness Environ Med|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=221–7|pmid=16366205|doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2005)16[221:WIAPCD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular claim that &quot;a person should consume eight glasses of water per day&quot; seems to have no real basis in science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 &quot;Drink at least eight glasses of water a day.&quot; Really? Is there scientific evidence for &quot;8 × 8&quot;?] by Heinz Valdin, Department of Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, [[New Hampshire]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar misconceptions concerning the effect of water on weight loss and constipation have also been dispelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factsmart.org/h2o/h2o.htm Drinking Water – How Much?], Factsmart.org web site and references within&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D-P005 Kein Trinkwasser.svg|thumb|right|[[Hazard symbol]] for non-potable water]]
An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the [[United States National Research Council]] read: &quot;An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances.|publisher=National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122|year=1945|pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest dietary reference intake report by the [[United States National Research Council]] in general recommended (including food sources): 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters of water total for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/report.asp?id=18495 Dietary Reference Intakes: Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, Food and Nutrition Board&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding]] women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The [[Institute of Medicine]] (U.S.) recommends that, on average, men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283|title=Water: How much should you drink every day?|publisher=Mayoclinic.com|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages ([[Caffeine|caffeinated]] included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.

Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,&lt;ref&gt;''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and/or harmful [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Vibrio]]''. Some [[Solution|solutes]] are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maton|first=Anthea|coauthors=Jean Hopkins, Charles William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill D. Wright|title=Human Biology and Health|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1993|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA|isbn=0-13-981176-1|oclc=32308337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1cV8tziHZ5sC&amp;pg=PA125|page=125|title=Water: a shared responsibility|author=Unesco|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2006|isbn=1-84545-177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washing====
The propensity of water to form [[Solvation|solutions]] and [[emulsion]]s is useful in various [[washing]] processes. Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances. Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]].

====Transportation====
The use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.

====Chemical uses====
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently.

====Heat exchange====
Water and steam are used as heat transfer fluids in diverse heat exchange systems, due to its availability and high heat capacity, both as a coolant and for heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. Condensing [[steam]] is a particularly efficient heating fluid because of the large heat of vaporization. A disadvantage is that water and steam are somewhat corrosive. In almost all electric [[power station]]s, water is the coolant, which vaporizes and drives steam [[turbine]]s to drive generators. In the U.S., cooling power plants is the largest use of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Water Use in the United States&quot;/&gt;

In the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[Void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]] – however other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.

====Fire extinction====
[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.

Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as [[coal]], [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].

The power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].

====Recreation====
[[File:Grand Anse Beach Grenada.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Anse Beach, St. George's, [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]]]]
{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}
Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or [[pond]]s for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.

====Water industry====
[[File:Water carrier.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in [[India]], 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]
[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in [[China]]]]
[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]
The [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to [[household]]s and [[industry]]. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.

Drinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.

The distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as [[Hong Kong]], sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].

Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].

Wastewater facilities are [[storm sewer]]s and [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]]. Another way to remove pollution from [[surface runoff]] water is [[bioswale]].

====Industrial applications====
Water is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a [[dam]] is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.

{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}

Pressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.

Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes ([[water pollution|chemical pollution]]) and discharged coolant water (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.

====Food processing====
[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]].]]
[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular [[cooking]] methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam. Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]]. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn is affected by [[altitude]]. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51 °C (32.918 °F), and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02 °C (33.836 °F); similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaclacik&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Food Science|url=http://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=2007|author=Vaclavik, Vickie A. and Christian, Elizabeth W|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-69939-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.&lt;ref name=&quot;deman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&amp;pg=PA434|title=Principles of Food Chemistry|year=1999|author=DeMan, John M|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-8342-1234-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaclacik&quot;/&gt; Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;deman&quot; /&gt; Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.

Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on the amounts of removable calcium carbonate salt the water contains per gallon. Water
hardness is measured in grains: 0.064 g calcium carbonate is
equivalent to one grain of hardness.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaclacik&quot;/&gt; Water is
classified as soft if it contains 1 to 4 grains, medium if it contains 5 to 10 grains and hard if it contains 11 to 20 grains.{{Vague|please add totally metric definition too.|date=December 2008}}&lt;ref name=&quot;vaclacik&quot;/&gt; 

The hardness of water also affects its pH balance, which plays a critical role in food processing. For example, hard water prevents successful production of clear beverages. Water hardness also affects sanitation; with increasing hardness, there is a loss of effectiveness for its use as a sanitizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaclacik&quot;/&gt;

According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires 15 thousand litres of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The green, blue and grey wate r footprint of farm animals and animal products, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48 - Volume 1: Main report|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf|work=The green, blue and grey wate r footprint of farm animals and animal products, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48 - Volume 1: Main report|publisher=UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education|accessdate=30 January 2014|author=M.M.

==Law, politics, and crisis==
{{Main|Water law|Water right|Water crisis}}
[[File:Access to drinking water in third world.svg|thumb|300px|An estimate of the share of people in developing countries with access to [[potable water]] 1970–2000]]
[[Water politics]] is [[politics]] affected by water and [[water resources]]. For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.

1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2008/MDG_Report_2008_En.pdf#page=44 The Millennium Development Goals Report], United Nations, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30% in 1970&lt;ref name=lomborg&gt;{{cite book|author=Lomborg, Björn|year=2001|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-01068-3|url=http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/69-file/skeptenvironChap1.pdf|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 71% in 1990, 79% in 2000 and 84% in 2004. This trend is projected to continue.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2008/MDG_Report_2008_En.pdf#page=44|title=MDG Report 2008|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. This goal is projected to be reached.

A 2006 [[United Nations]] report stated that &quot;there is enough water for everyone&quot;, but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], (2006), [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility. The United Nations World Water Development Report 2].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]], have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.&lt;ref&gt;Welle, Katharina; Evans, Barbara; Tucker, Josephine and Nicol, Alan (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/1894.pdf ''Is water lagging behind on Aid Effectiveness?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the 2007 [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]] cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx ''Water governance''], Water Issue Brief, Issue 5, 2010, [[IWMI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or [[drought]]. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal; see [[toilet]].

Organizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association. The [[International Water Management Institute]] undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and [[Ramsar Convention]]. [[World Day for Water]] takes place on 22 March and [[World Ocean Day]] on 8 June.

==In culture==

===Religion===
{{Main|Water and religion}}
Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Major faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]''). Water is mentioned numerous times in the [[Bible]], for example: &quot;The earth was formed out of water and by water&quot; (NIV). In the Qur'an it is stated that &quot;Living things are made of water&quot; and it is often used to describe paradise.

===Philosophy===
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] held that water is one of the four [[classical elements]] along with [[fire]], earth and [[Air (classical element)|air]], and was regarded as the [[ylem]], or basic substance of the universe. Water was considered cold and moist. In the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]]. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].

Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the Dao De Jing states &quot;The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao&quot; and &quot;There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm|title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water.  Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube shaped earth.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] (1852) is part of the [[Tate Gallery]] collection. His painting influenced the image in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''Hamlet''.]]
Water is used in literature as a symbol of purification. Examples include the critical importance of a river in ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' by [[William Faulkner]] and the drowning of [[Ophelia]] in ''[[Hamlet]]''.

[[Sherlock Holmes]] held that &quot;From a drop of water, a logician could infer the possibility of an [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] or a [[Niagara Falls|Niagara]] without having seen or heard of one or the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', Chapter 2, &quot;The Science of Deduction&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wood''' is a hard, fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of [[trees]] and other [[woody plant]]s. It has been used for thousands of years for both [[fuel]] and as a construction material.  It is an organic material, a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers (which are strong in tension) embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] which resists compression.  Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.; King, C.|year=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in tree roots or in other plants such as shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also mediates the transfer of water and [[nutrients]] to the [[leaves]] and other growing tissues.  Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.

The Earth contains about one trillion tonnes of wood, which grows at a rate of 10 billion tonnes per year. As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy.  In 1991, approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested.  Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Horst H. Nimz, Uwe Schmitt, Eckart Schwab, Otto Wittmann, Franz Wolf &quot;Wood&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A 2011 discovery in the Canadian [[Canadian province|province]] of [[New Brunswick]] uncovered the earliest known plants to have grown wood, approximately 395 to 400 [[million years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|title=N.B. fossils show origins of wood|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have used wood for millennia for many purposes, primarily as a [[fuel]] or as a construction material for making houses, tools, [[weapon]]s, furniture, packaging, artworks, and paper.

Wood can be dated by [[carbon dating]] and in some species by [[dendrochronology]] to make inferences about when a wooden object was created.

The year-to-year variation in tree-ring widths and isotopic abundances gives [[proxy (climate)|clues]] to the prevailing climate at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briffa, 2008&quot; &gt;{{cite journal

==Physical properties==

===Growth rings===
Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by trees, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as secondary growth; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells.
Where there are clear seasons, growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If these seasons are annual these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is no seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.

If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] www.farmforestline.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).

===Knots===
[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|240px|A knot on a tree at the [[Garden of the Gods]] public park in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado (October 2006)]]
A knot is a particular type of imperfection in a piece of wood; it will affect the  technical properties of the wood, usually for the worse, but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular &quot;solid&quot; (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[Wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood &quot;flows&quot; (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.

In the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.

During the development of a tree, the lower limbs often die, but may remain attached for a time, sometimes years. Subsequent layers of growth of the attaching stem are no longer intimately joined with the dead limb, but are grown around it. Hence, dead branches produce knots which are not attached, and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards.

In grading lumber and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|Wood Knot]]
Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than where under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress. Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.

In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest.  In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain.  A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution, correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.

===Heartwood and sapwood===&lt;!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood and dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot). The dark radial lines are small knots.]]
Heartwood (or duramen&lt;ref name=eb-alburnum&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay.  Heartwood formation occurs spontaneously (it is a genetically programmed process). Once heartwood formation is complete, the heartwood is dead.{{sfn|Capon|2005|p=65}} Some uncertainty still exists as to whether heartwood is truly dead, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.&lt;ref&gt;Shigo 1986, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually heartwood looks different; in that case it can be seen on a cross-section, usually following the growth rings in shape. Heartwood may (or may not) be much darker than living wood. It may (or may not) be sharply distinct from the sapwood. However, other processes, such as decay, can discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, with a similar color difference, which may lead to confusion.

Sapwood (or alburnum&lt;ref name=&quot;eb-alburnum&quot; /&gt;) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,{{sfn|Capon|2005|p=65}} and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, 30&amp;nbsp;cm or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.

The term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[Ash tree|ash]], hickory, [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.

When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.

It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.

===Color===
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color difference does not mean a dramatic difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a dramatic chemical difference.

Some experiments on very resinous [[Longleaf Pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called &quot;fat lighter&quot;. Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.

[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast Redwood]] is distinctively red in color]]
Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood not infrequently appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Except in the manner just stated the color of wood is no indication of strength.

Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

===Water content===
Water occurs in living wood in three conditions, namely: (1) in the [[cell wall]]s, (2) in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and (3) as free water in the cell cavities and spaces. In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.

The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on paper or [[Textile|cloth]]. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&amp;nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[Yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[Elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.

===Structure===
Wood is a [[heterogeneous]], [[hygroscopic]], [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] material. It is composed of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of [[cellulose]] (40%&amp;nbsp;– 50%) and [[hemicellulose]] (15%&amp;nbsp;– 25%) impregnated with [[lignin]] (15%&amp;nbsp;– 30%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/components/6413ch1.html Lesson 1: ''Tree Growth and Wood Material'' at University of Minnesota Extension]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Drva.JPG|thumb|Sections of [[tree trunk]]]]
[[File:VeluweTreeTrunk.jpg|thumb|right|A tree trunk as found at the [[Veluwe]], Netherlands]]

In coniferous or softwood species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, [[tracheid]]s, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods. There are no vessels (&quot;pores&quot;) in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.

The structure of hardwoods is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwsp.edu/papersci/biasca/ps350/Hardwood%20Structure.htm Hardwood Structure]{{dead link|date=July 2013}} www.uwsp.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by vessels: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others ([[Aesculus|buckeye]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]]) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ''ring-porous'' and ''diffuse-porous''.&lt;ref name=sperry1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperry|first=John S. |coauthors=Nichols, Kirk L., Sullivan, June E, Eastlack, Sondra E., |title=Xylem Embolism in ring-porous, diffuse-porous, and coniferous trees of Northern Utah and Interior Alaska |journal=Ecology |year=1994 |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1736–1752 |jstor=1939633 |doi=10.2307/1939633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, [[catalpa]], chestnut, [[elm]], hickory, mulberry,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and oak,&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localised in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fiber are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[File:BlkWalnut-x-section.jpg|thumb|Magnified cross-section of [[Juglans nigra|Black Walnut]], showing the vessels, rays (white lines) and annual rings: this is intermediate between diffuse-porous and ring-porous, with vessel size declining gradually]]
In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row. Examples of this kind of wood are [[Alnus|alder]],&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; [[Tilia|basswood]],{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[birch]],&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; buckeye, maple, willow,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} and the [[Populus]] species such as aspen, cottonwood and poplar.&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; Some species, such as [[walnut]] and [[cherry]], are on the border between the two classes, forming an intermediate group.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

====Earlywood and latewood in softwood====
[[File:Wood Pseudotsuga taxifolia.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Earlywood and latewood in a softwood; radial view, growth rings closely spaced in a [[List of trees and shrubs by taxonomic family|Pseudotsuga taxifolia]]]]
In temperate softwoods there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pine]]s there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.

It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain but little. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.

No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.

[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a [[Fraxinus excelsior]] ; tangential view, wide growth rings]]
In ring-porous woods each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.

In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.

In ring-porous woods of good growth it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.

Wide-ringed wood is often called &quot;second-growth&quot;, because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such &quot;second-growth&quot; hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important. The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:
:&quot;The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough.&quot;&lt;ref name=USforest&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material]''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarised by the same authority as follows:

:&quot;When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.&quot;&lt;ref name=USforest/&gt;

====Earlywood and latewood in diffuse-porous woods====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.

In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.

===Monocot wood===
[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Trunks of the [[Coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]
Structural material that resembles ordinary, &quot;dicot&quot; or conifer wood in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produce material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the structural material is quite different from ordinary wood.

==Hard and soft woods==
There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example,  [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].

It is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.

==Chemistry of wood==
[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|300px|Chemical structure of lignin, which comprises approximately 30% of wood and is responsible for many of its properties.]]
Aside from water, wood has three main components.  [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%.  Next in abundance is hemicellulose, which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose.  Lignin is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs 23% in deciduous trees.  Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose.  A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.

In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]].  Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]].  Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.&lt;ref name=boerjan&gt;{{cite journal| author =  W. Boerjan, J. Ralph, M. Baucher|date=June 2003| title = Lignin biosynthesis| journal = Ann. Rev.

===Extractives===
Aside from the lignocellulose, wood consists of a variety of low [[molecular weight]] [[organic compound]]s, called ''extractives''. The wood [[extract]]ives are [[fatty acids]], [[resin acids]], [[waxes]] and [[terpene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mimms | first = Agneta | coauthors = Michael J. Kuckurek, Jef A.

==Uses==

===Fuel===
{{Main|Wood fuel}}
Wood has a long history of being used as fuel, which continues to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/woodstoves/index.html Clean Burning Wood Stoves and Fireplaces]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wooden Miracle Kizhi.jpg|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]

[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1]”,''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Construction===
Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction.  [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).

Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America.  Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.  In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors.   Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].

New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.

In buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.

Wood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mould into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.

====Wood flooring====
{{Main | Wood flooring}}

====Engineered wood====
{{main |Engineered wood}}

[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]
Engineered wood products, glued building products &quot;engineered&quot; for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;apawood&quot;&gt;[http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf APA Engineered Wood Construction Guide, Form E30]&lt;/ref&gt;

These products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL)  products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.&lt;ref name=&quot;apawood&quot; /&gt;  Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.

Wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[synthetic material]]s. Wood derivatives can also be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].

===Furniture and utensils===
Wood has always been used extensively for furniture, such as chairs and beds. Also for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]].

===Next generation wood products===
Further developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
As scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements&quot;  I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the arts===
[[File:Woodcarvings of cranes.jpg|right|thumb|Artists can use wood to create delicate sculptures.]]
[[File:Violin-bows.jpg|left|thumb|Stringed instrument bows are often made from [[pernambuco]] or [[brazilwood]].]]
{{Main|Wood as a medium}}
Wood has long been used as an [[Media (arts)|artistic medium]].  It has been used to make sculptures and [[Wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]''), and the Millennium clock tower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ProfessionalNetSolutions.com |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/sharmanka.kinetic/clocktower/ |title=The Millennium Clock Tower at Edinburgh Royal Museum |publisher=Freespace.virgin.net |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; now housed in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/nationalmuseumhomepage.aspx]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Edinburgh]].

It is also used in [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]], and for [[Wood engraving|engraving]].

Certain types of [[musical instrument]]s, such as those of the [[violin family]], the guitar, the [[clarinet]] and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], the [[xylophone]], and the [[marimba]], are made mostly or entirely of wood. The choice of wood may make a significant difference to the tone and resonant qualities of the instrument, and [[tonewood]]s have widely differing properties, ranging from the hard and dense [[african blackwood]] (used for the bodies of clarinets) to the light but resonant European spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') (traditionally used for the soundboards of violins).  The most valuable tonewoods, such as the ripple sycamore (''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]''), used for the backs of violins, combine acoustic properties with decorative color and grain which enhance the appearance of the finished instrument.

Despite their collective name, not all woodwind instruments are made entirely of wood.  The [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]] used to play them, however, are usually made from ''[[Arundo donax]]'', a type of [[monocot]] [[cane]] plant.

{{clear}}

===Sports and recreational equipment===
Many types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past.  For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]].  The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile.  In [[softball]], however, bats are more commonly made of [[aluminium]] (this is especially true for [[fastpitch softball]]). NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[hardwood]],Main article:       [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA]].

Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[fiberglass]], [[carbon fiber]], [[titanium]], and [[composite material]]s.  One noteworthy example of this trend is the [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]] commonly known as the ''[[Wood (golf)|wood]]'', the head of which was traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but is now generally made of synthetic materials.

===Medicine===
In January 2010 Italian scientists announced that wood could be harnessed to become a [[bone grafting|bone substitute]]. It is likely to take at least five years until this technique will be applied for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8438209.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scientists make bones from wood | date=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacterial Degradation==

Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose.

For over half of century, the technology of [[microelectronics]] has been advancing by [[miniaturization]], leading to significant increases in computing power and continuous decreases in manufacturing cost. In parallel, remarkable progress on enlarging system scale in recent years gives rise to a nascent field known as macroelectronics, in which microelectronic devices are distributed yet integrated over large area substrates with sizes much bigger than [[semiconductor]] [[wafers]].

Currently, the macroelectronics industry is dramatically growing in the similar way as the [[microelectronics]] was in early ’90s. The most visible example of macroelectronics at present is [[flat-panel display]]s, which have been rapidly replacing cathode-ray tubes as the monitors of choice for computers and televisions since 2000. The flat-panel displays have enabled applications unimaginable for cathode-ray tubes. For example, the Dolphins Stadium in Miami will soon have the world’s largest high definition video display, about 15 m high and 42 m wide, comprising more than 4.6 million [[light-emitting diode]]s, showing image of more than 1.5 million pixels.

While the commercial success of flat-panel display opens an era of large area electronics, other emerging applications, such as [[rollable display]], printable [[thin film solar cell]] and [[electronic skin]], demonstrate further desirable attributes for macroelectronic systems, including flexibility, portability and low-cost. To realize these attributes, a growing trend is to fabricate macroelectronic products directly on flexible substrates, such as [[polymer]]s. The flat-panel displays currently available in market are fabricated on glass substrates and are fragile. A case in recent news is the cracking of the screens of the [[iPod nano]], a music player that [[Apple Computer]] expects to be its best-selling portable device. By contrast, displays made on thin polymer substrates are rugged. Flexible displays of large areas will be lightweight and can be rolled up – they will be portable. For example, in Sept. 2005, [[Philips]] [[Polymer Vision]] has revealed the world's first prototype of a rollable electronic reader, which can unfold to a 5-inch display and roll back into a pocket-size (100×60×20&amp;nbsp;mm) device. Furthermore, such thin-film devices on flexible polymer substrates can lend themselves to low-cost fabrication process (i.e., [[roll-to-roll printing]]), resulting in lightweight, rugged and flexible macroelectronic products.

'''Cryotronics''' is the production of [[electronics]] that utilize [[superconductivity]], and is not to be confused with [[cryoelectronics]] or cryolectronics.  The simplest use of cryotronics is the [[cryotron]], which is a switch.  [[Rapid single flux quantum]] digital electronics technology is a good example of cryotronics, as it is based on superconductors. Additionally, the sensitive [[amplifiers]] used in [[radio telescope]]s are cooled using [[liquid helium]] to reduce [[thermal noise]]. Cryotronics includes creating,
1.'''supersensitive miniature receivers''' for detecting weak radio signals.
2.'''a crytron switch''' depends on the effect of inducing persistent current in a closed superconducting circuit for eg.ring

'''Bioelectronics''' is a recently coined term for a field of research that works to establish a synergy between [[electronics]] and [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/bioelectronics_report.cfm |title = A Framework for Bioelectronics: Discovery and Innovation |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main forums for information about the field is the [[Elsevier]] journal ''[[Biosensors and Bioelectronics]]'', published since 1990. The journal describes the scope of bioelectronics as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emerging field of Bioelectronics seeks to exploit biology in conjunction with electronics in a wider context encompassing, for example, biological fuel cells, bionics and biomaterials for information processing, information storage, electronic components and actuators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">'''Atomtronics''' is the branch of [[science]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]] that deals with the creation of analogues to [[electronic circuit]]s and [[Electronics#Electronic devices and components|devices]] by the use of [[atom]]s.  Atomtronics is an [[emerging technology]] that offers a wide range of applications.

== Theory ==
When super-cooled to form [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, atoms placed in an [[optical lattice]] may form states analogous to electrons in solid-state crystalline media such as [[semiconductor]]s. Impurity doping allows the creation of n and p-type semiconductor analogue states, and an atomtronic [[battery (electricity)|battery]] can be created by maintaining two contacts at different [[chemical potential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;B.

== Application ==
Atomtronic devices are still in the experimental stage, and for the future, the properties of condensed atoms offer a wide range of possible applications.  The use of ultra-cold atoms leads to circuit elements that allow for the coherent flow of information and may be useful in connecting classical electronic devices and [[quantum computer]]s.  The use of atomtronics may allow for quantum computers that work on macroscopic scales and do not require the technological precision of [[laser]]-controlled few-ion computing methods.  Since the atoms are Bose-condensed, they have the property of superfluidity and, therefore, have resistance-free current in which no energy is lost or heat dissipated, similar to superconducting electronic devices.  The vast knowledge of electronics may be leveraged to easily adapt to ultra-cold atomtronic circuits. Atomtronics can not replace electronics due to the atoms being too slow.

'''Differential Mobility Detector (DMD)''' is a type of microelectromechanical system, radio frequency modulated [[Ion mobility spectrometry|IMS]] (MEMS RF-IMS) device. 
[[Image:CP-4900 4chan with DMD.jpg|thumb|right|Varian CP-4900 MicroGC, four channel, with Differential Mobility Detector (first from the right)]]

Though its small in size, it easily fits into portable units, such as transferable gas chromatographs or drug/explosives sensors. For instance, it was incorporated by [[Varian]] in its CP-4900 DMD MicroGC, and by [[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Thermo Fisher]] in its EGIS Defender system, designed to detect narcotics and explosives in transportation or other homeland security applications. 

== Specifications for DMD as part of Varian CP-4900 MicroGC&lt;ref&gt;Varian document CP501677, February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ==

* Detection limit: 100 ppb for MES
* Dynamic range: 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Relative standard deviation|RSD]] &lt; 2% at 10 times the [[Low detection limit|LDL]]
* Gas requirements: 400 mL/min ‘Zero’ Air or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;The authors of [http://gazanaliz.ru/articles/DMD/DMD.htm this article] note that one 5 liter gas cylinder of [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zero_air Zero Air] was enough for three to four days of normal work in the field.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, independent researchers&lt;ref&gt;[http://gazanaliz.ru/articles/DMD/DMD.htm ''in Russian'': Zhiltsov I.N. and Chupin V.V., '''New Possibilities of Gas Chromatographic Analysis: the Differential Mobility Detector (DMD)''']&lt;/ref&gt; report that [[Relative standard deviation|RSD]] for such compounds as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[Methanethiol|methyl mercaptan]], and [[Ethanethiol|ethyl mercaptan]] is from 4 to 11%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2247">'''Microelectronics''' is a subfield of [[electronics]]. As the name suggests, microelectronics relates to the study and manufacture (or [[microfabrication]]) of very small electronic designs and components.  Usually,  but not always, this means micrometre-scale or smaller.  These devices are typically made from [[semiconductor]] materials. Many components of normal electronic design are available in a microelectronic equivalent.  These include [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s and (naturally) [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s and [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s can all be found in microelectronic devices. Unique wiring techniques such as [[wire bonding]] are also often used in microelectronics because of the unusually small size of the components, leads and pads. This technique requires specialized equipment and is expensive.

Digital [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) consist mostly of transistors.  Analog circuits commonly contain resistors and capacitors as well.  Inductors are used in some high frequency analog circuits, but tend to occupy large chip area if used at low frequencies; [[gyrator]]s can replace them in many applications. 

As techniques improve, the scale of microelectronic components continues to decrease.  At smaller scales, the relative impact of intrinsic circuit properties such as interconnections may become more significant.  These are called '''parasitic effects''', and the goal of the microelectronics design engineer is to find ways to compensate for or to minimize these effects, while always delivering smaller, faster, and cheaper devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">'''Coil noise''' is a phenomenon in electronics which produces both undesirable audible sound and [[electronic noise]].

==Description==
Coil noise is, as its name suggests, caused by [[electromagnetic coil]]s. These coils, which may act as [[inductor]]s or [[transformer]]s, have a certain [[Electrical resonance|resonant frequency]] when coupled with the rest of the [[electrical network|electric circuit]], as well as a resonance at which it will tend to physically vibrate. 

As the wire that makes up the coil passes a [[Signal (electronics)|variable current]], a small amount of electrical [[oscillation]] occurs, creating a small [[radio frequency|magnetic field]]. Normally this magnetic field simply works to establish the [[inductance]] of the coil. However, this magnetic field can also cause the coil itself to physically vibrate.  As the coil vibrates physically, it moves through a variable magnetic field, and feeds its resonance back into the system. This can produce signal interference in the circuit and an audible hum as the coil vibrates.  

Coil noise can happen, for example, when the coil is poorly secured to the [[circuit board]], is poorly [[damping|damped]], or if the resonant frequency of the coil is close to the resonant frequency of the electric circuit. The effect becomes more pronounced as the signal passing through the coil increases in strength, and as it nears the resonant frequency of the coil, or as it nears the resonant frequency of the circuit. Coil noise is also noticed most often when it is in the [[Audio frequency|humanly audible frequency]]. 

Coil noise is also affected by the irregularities of the magnetic material within the coil. The [[Magnetic flux|flux density]] of the inductor is effected by these irregularities, causing small currents in the coil, contaminating the original signal. This particular subset of is sometimes referred to as [[magnetic fluctuation noise]] or the [[Barkhausen effect]]. Coil noise can also occur in conjunction with the noise produced by [[magnetostriction]].

==Devices generating coil noise==
Any device with heavy currents passed through coils may produce acoustic noise. It can be objectionable in some classes of equipment.  [[Fluorescent lamp]] ballasts are one example of devices that are designed to minimize coil noise. 

The amount of coil noise in a device will often seem to increase as the devices age. This can be due to many factors, but is often due to the degradation of the damping materials in the circuit. As an example, a layer of glue is often added atop coils in televisions. Over the years, this glue degrades due to age and due to the years of vibration it has been subjected to. As a result, the coil is able to move more as it vibrates, and the sound level increases.

==Reducing coil noise==
Some steps to reducing coil noise include: 

*As previously mentioned, damping is a critical step towards reducing coil noise.
*Low noise coils are specifically produced to avoid coil noise.
*Coil noise can be reduced in some instances by changing the shape of the coil to a [[wikt:figure eight|figure eight]] rather than a traditional coil shape.

Coil noise can be reduced by damping and can be minimized by design, but in some cases, unacceptable levels will remain. To combat this, the coils are sometimes isolated from the rest of the device. They can be placed in such a way as to absorb and contain the noise and vibration that occurs.

'''Electric Field Proximity Sensing''' or EFPS is a sensory system that relies on the fact that an electric field can be perturbed by the existence of a nearby object, provided it is at least slightly conductive.  One type of EFPS is The People Detector.  The People Detector is a micro-electronic based device that can detect the presence of both moving and stationary objects through solid materials.  Its ability to operate through any non-conductive material permits complete invisibility. The sensor functions by detecting small changes in an ultra-low-power electromagnetic field generated between two remotely located antenna electrodes.  Its range is adjustable from a few centimetres [inches] to  4 m [over 12 feet].&lt;ref name=Bik&gt;{{cite web|title=(untitled homepage)|url=http://bik.com/|work=bik.com (website)|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric field proximity detectors can detect partially conducting or conducting objects and does not depend on impedance to ground.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schyndel, Andre J. Patent No. 6859141 2/22/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

Because EF sensors provide comparatively low amounts of data, they have the potential to provide several advantages over optical systems.  Electric field systems can be made smaller, lighter, and power efficient (valuable qualities in an age of ever shrinking electronics such as palm and watch based computers). Since EF sensors penetrate non-conducting materials, they can remain hidden allowing them to remain protected from weather. EFPS systems today are used in a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications, including automobile airbag systems (to determine where passengers are seated), in advanced robotic manipulators (to determine the properties of an object in the manipulator's grasp), and in [[home automation]], to determine which rooms are occupied.

==Electric fish==

This is the same sensing system that is used by the [[electric catfish]] to navigate through muddy waters.  These fish make use of spectral changes and amplitude modulation to determine factors such shape, size, distance, velocity, and conductivity.  The abilities of the electric fish to communicate and identify sex, age, and hierarchy within the species are also made possible through electric fields.  EF gradients as low as 5nV/cm can be found in some saltwater weakly electric fish.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, T., Smith, J., Paradiso, J., Allport, D., &amp; Gershenfeld, N. (1995). Applying Electric Field Sensing to Human-Computer Interfaces. IEEE SIG .&lt;/ref&gt;

==MIT prototype==

Researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] have created a prototype of a 3-dimensional EFPS called the &quot;Fish&quot;. It can monitor objects in a 3-dimensional space. The People Detector operates in only 2-dimensions and does not have a microprocessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bik&quot; /&gt;

==Technology review==

''Technology Review'', a science and technology magazine published by MIT, featured EFPS in their September 2007 computing section. Intel had created a robotic arm that could distinguish between plastic bottles that had water present or not. The robotic arm did not have to touch the bottles to determine which ones had water inside. Researchers applied an oscillating voltage to an electrode, in the thumb of the robot for example, which created an electric field.  As the field interacted with the water in the bottle, special sensors could determine the change in the electric field and then cause the robot to behave in certain ways.&lt;ref name=Robots&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Kate|title=Robots That Sense Before They Touch|journal=Technology Review|date=September 17, 2007|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19389/?a=f|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piezotronics effect''' is using the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) created in materials with [[piezoelectricity]] as a “gate” voltage to tune/control the charge carrier transport properties for fabricating new devices. The fundamental principle of piezotronics was introduced by Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2007 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2007/07_AM_5.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang, “Nanopiezotronics”, Advanced Materials, 2007, 19, 889-892.&lt;/ref&gt;
A serials of electronic devices have been demonstrated based on this effect, including piezopotential gated [[field-effect transistor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2006/06_NL_9.pdf] Xudong Wang, Jun Zhou, Jinhui Song, Jin Liu, Ningsheng Xu, and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezoelectric Field Effect Transistor and Nanoforce Sensor Based on a Single ZnO Nanowire”, Nano Letters, 2006, 6, 2768-2772.&lt;/ref&gt; piezopotential gated [[diode]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.200601908] Jr-Hau He, Cheng-Lun Hsin, Jin Liu, Lih-Juann Chen and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezoelectric Gated Diode of a Single ZnO Nanowire”, Advanced Materials, 2007, 19, 781-784.&lt;/ref&gt;  strain [[sensors]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2008new/08_2367t.pdf] Jun Zhou, Yudong Gu, Peng Fei, Wenjie Mai, Yifan Gao, Rusen Yang, Gang Bao and Zhong Lin Wang, “Flexible Piezotronic Strain Sensor”,  Nano Letters, 2008, 8, 3035-3040.&lt;/ref&gt; force/flow sensors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2009new/09_NL_09.pdf] Peng Fei, Ping-Hung Yeh, Jun Zhou, Sheng Xu,Yifan Gao, Jinhui Song, Yudong Gu,Yanyi Huang and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezoelectric Potential Gated Field-Effect Transistor Based on a Free-Standing ZnO Wire”, Nano Letters, 2009, 9, 3435-3439.&lt;/ref&gt; hybrid [[field-effect transistor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_NL_02.pdf] Weihua Liu, Minbaek Lee, Lei Ding, Jie Liu, and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezopotential Gated Nanowire-Nanotube Hybrid Field-Effect Transistor”, Nano Letters, 2010, 10, 3084-3089.&lt;/ref&gt; piezotronic [[logic gate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_AM_05.pdf] Wenzhuo Wu, Yaguang Wei, Zhong Lin Wang, “Strain-Gated Piezotronic Logic Nanodevices”, Advanced materials, 2010, 22, 4711-4715.&lt;/ref&gt; electromechanical [[memories]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2011/11_NL_04.pdf] Wenzhuo Wu and Zhong Lin Wang, “Piezotronic Nanowire-Based Resistive Switches As Programmable Electromechanical Memories”, Nano Letters, 2011, 11, 2779–2785.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Piezotronic devices are regarded as a new semiconductor-device category. Piezotronics is likely to have important applications in [[sensor]], human-silicon technology interfacing, [[MEMS]], nanorobotics and active flexible electronics.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Piezotronics2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Working mechanism for piezoelectric devices with one end of the piezoelectric material is fixed. The induced piezopotential distribution is similar to the applied gate voltage in a traditional [[field-effect transistor]], as shown in (b).]]
[[File:Coupling.png|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Schematic diagram showing the three-way coupling among [[piezoelectricity]], photoexcitation and [[semiconductor]].]]
Due to the non-central [[symmetry]] in materials such as the [[wurtzite]] structured [[ZnO]], [[GaN]] and [[InN]], a piezopotential is created in the [[crystal]] by applying a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. Owing to the simultaneous possession of [[piezoelectricity]] and [[semiconductor]] properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport process.  Generally, the construction of the basic piezotronic devices can be divided into two categories. Here we use the nanowires as the example. The first kind is that the piezoelectric nanowire was put on a flexible substrate with two ends fixed by the electrodes. In this case, when the substrate is bended, the nanowire will be purely stretched or compressed.  Piezopotential will be introduced along its axis.  It will modify the [[electric field]] or the [[Schottky barrier]] (SB) height at the contact area. The induced positive piezopotential at one end will reduce the SB height, while the negative piezopotential at the other end will increase it. Thus the electric transport properties will be changed. The second kind of the piezotronic device is that one end of the nanowire is fixed with electrode, while the other end is free. In this case, when a force is applied at the free end of the nanowire to bend it, the piezopotential distribution will be perpendicular to the axis of the nanowire.  The introduced piezoelectric field is perpendicular to electron transport direction, just like applying a [[gate voltage]] in the traditional [[field-effect transistor]]. Thus the electron transport properties will also be changed. 
The materials for piezotronics should be piezoelectric semiconductors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_NTD_02.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang “Piezopotential Gated Nanowire Devices: Piezotronics and Piezo-phototronics”, Nano Today, 5 (2010) 540-552.&lt;/ref&gt; such as ZnO, GaN and InN. Three-way coupling among [[piezoelectricity]], photoexcitation and semiconductor is the basis of piezotronics (piezoelectricity-semiconductor coupling), piezophotonics (piezoelectric-photon excitation coupling), [[optoelectronics]], and [[piezophototronics]] (piezoelectricity-semiconductor-photoexcitation). The core of these coupling relies on the piezopotential created by the piezoelectric materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoscience.gatech.edu/paper/2010/10_NTD_02.pdf] Zhong Lin Wang “Piezopotential Gated Nanowire Devices: Piezotronics and Piezo-phototronics”, Nano Today, 5 (2010) 540-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Balcom DuMont''' (January 29, 1901 – November 14, 1965) also spelled '''Du Mont''', was an American electronics engineer, [[science|scientist]] and  [[invention|inventor]] best known for improvements to the [[cathode ray tube]] in 1931 for use in [[television]] receivers. Seven years later he manufactured and sold the first commercially practical television set to the public. In June 1938, his Model 180 television receiver was the first all-electronic television set ever sold to the public, a few months prior to [[RCA]]'s first set in April 1939. In 1946, DuMont founded the first [[television network]] to be licensed, the [[DuMont Television Network]], initially by linking station [[WNYW|WABD]] (named for DuMont) in [[New York City]] to station W3XWT, which later became [[WTTG]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] (WTTG was named for Dr. [[Thomas T. Goldsmith]], DuMont's Vice President of Research, and his best friend.) DuMont's successes in television picture tubes, TV sets and components and his involvement in commercial TV broadcasting made him the first millionaire in the business.

==Biography==

===Early life===
DuMont was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. At the age of 10, he was stricken with [[polio]] and was quarantined at his family's [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]] apartment for nearly a year. During his quarantine, his father brought home books and magazines for the young DuMont to read while bedridden. At this time, DuMont developed an interest in science, specifically wireless [[radio]] communication, and taught himself [[Morse code]].

His father bought him a [[crystal radio receiver]] which he assembled, took apart, reassembled and rebuilt several times. He improved his set each time he rebuilt it and later built a transmitter, while his father obtained the landlord's permission to erect a {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}} high [[Transceiver|transceiving]] [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] on the roof.

While recuperating from polio, DuMont was advised to [[human swimming|swim]] to regain the use of his legs. In 1914, the family moved to [[Cedar Grove, New Jersey]], where there was an indoor year-round pool available at the local [[YMCA]]. He graduated from [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]] in 1919, and went to [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]], where he was part of the Alpha Chapter of the [[Theta Xi]] Fraternity.

===Radio and early interest in television===
In 1915, DuMont became the youngest American to obtain a first class commercial radio operator's license at age 14. The following summer, he worked as a radio operator aboard a coastal steamer making runs from New York to [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. As the summers went by, he made his way to the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]] and, after [[World War I]], to [[Europe]], where, during the summer of 1922, he was stuck in [[Copenhagen]] for months because of a dock workers' strike.

After graduating from Rensselaer in 1924, DuMont worked at the [[Westinghouse Lamp Plant|Westinghouse Lamp Company]] in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]], in charge of [[vacuum tube|radio tube]] production. While there, he increased production from 500 tubes per day to an astounding 50,000 tubes per day. Management decided to give him a $500 bonus, a small raise, and the &quot;Westinghouse Award&quot;, an award devised to recognize his accomplishments. The &quot;Westinghouse Award&quot; was later presented as a scholarship award to high school seniors showing promise in a field of science (and continues to this day as the [[Intel Science Talent Search]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DuMont|first=Allen B.|title=Allen B.

By 1928, DuMont was searching for new opportunities and was wooed by Dr. [[Lee De Forest]], a radio pioneer who developed the [[audion tube]], the original voice amplifier for radio reception. De Forest had a checkered career as an inventor and had several failed business ventures. DuMont was hired as vice president and production manager for radio tubes. He revamped the factory with newly designed machinery:  &quot;a high speed sealing machine, automatic grid winding and welding machine, base branding machine, basing and wire cutting machine, high frequency bombarder and numerous tube-characteristic test sets and life racks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1946 ''Current Biography Yearbook''&lt;/ref&gt; Factory capacity was increased to 30,000 tubes per day.

When De Forest took over the mechanical television system of [[C. Francis Jenkins]], DuMont turned his attention to television. He was involved in the first television transmissions from W2XCD in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]]. But DuMont realized that clear images would need the development of scanning in a cathode ray tube. DuMont worked to improve television transmission and reception and went to De Forest asking for funds to build a long lasting cathode ray tube for television reception. De Forest denied DuMont's request as De Forest's investors were demanding better returns. Subsequently, DuMont resigned at the same time that De Forest sold his radio manufacturing business to [[David Sarnoff]] at RCA.

===The Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) and the Oscillograph===

[[File:DuMont 164 Oscillograph 1939-40.jpg|thumbnail|DuMont 164 Oscillograph (1939-40). An Early General Purpose Oscillograph]]

DuMont had developed an improved version of the cathode ray tube which was both cheaper to produce and was longer-lasting than the German tubes used at that time; the imported tubes had a life of 25 to 30 hours. DuMont's invention of the first long-lasting cathode ray tube would later make commercially-viable television possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=DuMont|title=Allen B.

In 1931, he sold two tubes to two college science laboratories for $35 each.

Since DuMont was a leader in [[cathode ray tube]] or CRT design and manufacturing, it was a natural step to use the CRT as a visual measuring instrument or [[oscilloscope]]. The production of CRT's and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories located in Upper Montclair, NJ. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brittain|first=J. E.|title=Allen B. Dumont: A Pioneer In Electronic Instruments, Radio and Television|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=December 1997|pages=2081–2082|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=650186&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Dasc_p_Sequence%26filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A14184%29|accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not the inventor of the [[oscilloscope]], DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (he called them oscillographs) for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the trigger sweep [[oscilloscope]] using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the silicon controlled rectifier or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to show a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the measurement being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided stability in viewing.

The profits from the oscillographs helped him invest in [[television]] design and his DuMont TV Network.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=DuMont|first=Allen B.|title=Allen B. DuMont Dies at 64|work=reprint by tv-boxes.com|publisher=New York Times |date=November 16, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the time spent on his TV ventures proved to be  the end of his profitable oscillograph business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=fundinguniverse.com|title=Tektronix, Inc History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/tektronix-inc-history/|publisher=fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947 a young equipment manufacturer called [[Tektronix]] produced the model 511 Time Base Trigger and Sweep Oscilloscope for $795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tektronix Oscilloscope Museum|title=Classic Tek Scopes Timeline|url=http://www.tekscope-museum.de/Museum/Timeline/timeline.html|publisher=Tektronix Museum|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of time instead of frequency to measure a sweep across the CRT was [[Tektronix]]'s big selling point. Time measurements are easier to interpret pulses and complex waveforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rider|first=John F.|title=Encyclopedia of Cathode Ray Oscilloscopes|year=1950|publisher=John F. Rider Publisher Inc|location=New York, NY|pages=942–945}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been mentioned informally that Allen DuMont saw the model 511 demonstrated at an electronics show. He tried it and was impressed, but commented to [[Howard Vollum]] and [[Jack Murdock]], co-founders of [[Tektronix]] that it was too expensive and they would be lucky to sell any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tektronix Equipment|first=Museum of Vintage|title=The Founding Part 2|url=http://www.vintagetek.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tek-History-Anon-RevB-small.pdf|publisher=vintagetek.org, Portland OR|accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tektronix]]'s time base trigger and time sweep generator design would become the standard in the 1950s and into the 21st century. [[Tektronix]] would replace DuMont Oscillographs as the leading selling oscilloscope brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiscochs|first=Peter D.|title=Oscilloscope Development 1943-57|year=2009|publisher=Peter D. Hiscochs|location=Ryerson University|pages=33|url=http://www.ee.ryerson.ca:8080/~phiscock/papers/scope-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Fairchild]] Camera acquired DuMont Laboratories in 1960, oscilloscopes were still being made with the DuMont name brand. Allen DuMont became Group General Manager of the DuMont Division, until his death in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot; /&gt; All DuMont oscilloscopes in the late 1950s and after the [[Fairchild]] acquisition were using the time base trigger and time sweep generator method introduced by [[Tektronix]]. The DuMont line of oscilloscopes ended in the 1970s.

During the early years of World War II, DuMont received special government contracts to provide large {{convert|36|in|cm}} wide cathode ray tubes. These special tubes allowed scientists working on the [[Manhattan Project]] to study the action of accelerated electrons.

=== Other Allen DuMont achievements ===

In 1932, DuMont proposed a &quot;ship finder&quot; device to the [[United States Army Signal Corps]] at [[Fort Monmouth]], [[New Jersey]], that used radio wave distortions to locate objects on a cathode ray tube screen&amp;mdash;he had essentially invented [[radar]]. The military asked him, however, not to take out a patent for developing what they wanted to maintain as a secret, and so he is not often mentioned among those responsible for radar. He did, however, go on to develop long-range precision radar to aid the Allies during [[World War II]]. As a consequence the French Government knighted him in 1952.

[[File:1939 Mission Bell Model 410 with Magic Eye Tube.jpg|thumbnail|left|Magic Eye tube used for tuning in a 1939 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Mission Bell Model]] 410 radio. (green glow)]]
In 1932 DuMont invented the [[magic eye tube]] also known as the Electron Ray Tube,&lt;ref&gt;David Weinstein, ''The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television''. Temple University Press, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; used as a tuning accessory in radios and as a level meter in mono and stereo home [[reel-to-reel tape recorder]]s.  In the 1930s the manufacture of mechanical panel meters were labor-intensive and expensive. Magic eye tubes provided radio designers with a less expensive and more profittable way to add a feature usually found in higher price equipment. The general public reception was a success as customers like the green glow and the seemingly magical way it worked.  He released information on his invention the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot; /&gt;  He sold the patents and rights to RCA for $20,000 to help fund his other projects.

DuMont produced black and white televisions in the 1940s and 1950s that were generally regarded as offering highest quality and durability. Many of these premium sets included a built in AM/FM radio and record player.&lt;ref&gt;See a video of a 1949 DuMont Television Commercial at this link: ''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9525dRYiKM DuMont Television]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

DuMont sold his television manufacturing division to [[Emerson Radio]] in 1958, and sold the remainder of the company to [[Fairchild Camera and Instrument|Fairchild Camera]] in 1960. Fairchild later developed [[semiconductor]] [[Integrated circuit|microchips]]. [[Robert Noyce]], a co-founder of [[Intel]], originally worked for DuMont as an engineer.

==DuMont Television Network==
{{Main|DuMont Television Network}}
The DuMont Television Network was not an unqualified success, being faced with the major problem of how to make a profit without the benefit of an already established radio network as a base. After ten years, DuMont shuttered the network and sold what remained of his television operations to [[John Kluge]] in 1956, which Kluge renamed [[Metromedia]].  DuMont's partner, Thomas T. Goldsmith (for whom the Washington, D.C. station [[WTTG]] was named), remained on Metromedia's board of directors from this time all the way until Kluge sold the stations to the [[Fox Television Stations Group]].

==Awards, family and later life==
DuMont was the first to provide funding for educational television broadcasting. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, among them the [[Cross of Knight]] awarded by the French Government, the [[Horatio Alger Award]], the Westinghouse Award, and the DeForest Medal. He is also a holder of over 30 patents in cathode ray tubes and other television equipment.

Allen DuMont enjoyed sailing. He owned a cruiser the Hurricane III. He would participate in boat races and compete in sailing skills competition. He died in 1965 and is buried in [[Mount Hebron Cemetery, Montclair, New Jersey|Mount Hebron Cemetery]] in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. He was survived by his wife Ethel and their two children Allen Jr. and Yvonne.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot; /&gt; The television center at [[Montclair State University]] bears his name and produces programs for the [[NJTV]] system (formerly [[New Jersey Network]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Adjacent-channel interference''' (ACI) is [[Interference (communication)|interference]] caused by extraneous [[power (physics)|power]] from a [[signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] in an [[adjacent channel]]. ACI may be caused by inadequate filtering (such as incomplete filtering of unwanted [[modulation]] products in [[frequency modulation|FM]] systems), improper [[tuner (radio)|tuning]] or poor frequency control (in the reference channel, the interfering channel or both). 

ACI is distinguished from [[crosstalk]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal Standard 1037C [http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm Accessed: 2011-10-19. (Archived by WebCite at http://webcitation.org/62Z8qe0pC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast regulators frequently manage the broadcast spectrum in order to minimize adjacent-channel interference. For example, in North America, [[FM radio]] stations in a single region cannot be licensed on adjacent frequencies — that is, if a station is licensed on 99.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in a city, the frequencies of 99.3&amp;nbsp;MHz and 99.7&amp;nbsp;MHz cannot be used anywhere within a certain distance of that station's transmitter, and the second-adjacent frequencies of 99.1&amp;nbsp;MHz and 99.9&amp;nbsp;MHz are restricted to specialized usages such as low-power stations. Similar restrictions formerly applied to third-adjacent frequencies as well (i.e. 98.9&amp;nbsp;MHz and 100.1&amp;nbsp;MHz in the example above), but these are no longer observed. 

The adjacent-channel interference which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B is the sum of the power that B emits into A's channel—known as the &quot;unwanted emission&quot;, and represented by the ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B's channel, which is represented by the ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity). B emitting power into A's channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (unwanted emissions). It occurs because RF filters require a [[roll-off]], and do not eliminate a signal completely. Therefore, B emits some power in the adjacent channel which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B's channel due to the roll off of the selectivity filters. [[Selectivity (electronic)|Selectivity]] [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] are designed to &quot;select&quot; a channel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="784">The '''flywheel effect''' is the continuation of oscillations in an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] after the control stimulus has been removed. This is usually caused by interacting [[inductor|inductive]] and [[capacitor|capacitive]] elements in the oscillator. Circuits undergoing such oscillations are said to be '''flywheeling'''.

The flywheel effect may be desirable, such as in [[phase (waves)|phase]]-locked loops used in [[Synchronization|synchronous]] systems, or undesirable, such as in voltage-controlled oscillators.

Flywheel effect is used in '''class C''' modulation where efficiency of modulation can be achieved as high as 90%.

In [[electronics]], the '''form factor''' of an [[alternating current]] waveform (signal) is the ratio of the RMS ([[Root Mean Square]]) value to the [[Average rectified value|average value]] (mathematical mean of [[absolute value]]s of all points on the waveform).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stutz|first=Michael|title=Measurement of AC Magnitude|url=http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_1/3.html|work=BASIC AC THEORY|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies the ratio of the [[direct current]] of equal power relative to the given alternating current. The former can also be defined as the direct current that will produce equivalent heat.&lt;ref name=Dusza&gt;{{cite book|last=Dusza|first=Jacek|title=Podstawy Miernictwa (Foundations of Measurement)|year=2002|publisher=Wydawnictwo Politechniki Warszawskiej|location=Warszawa|isbn=83-7207-344-9|pages=323|coauthors=Grażyna Gortat, Antoni Leśniewski|pages=136-142, 197-203|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculating the form factor ==
For an ideal, continuous wave function over time T, the RMS can be calculated in [[integral]] form:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jędrzejewski&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jędrzejewski|first=Kazimierz|title=Laboratorium Podstaw Pomiarow|year=2007|publisher=Wydawnictwo Politechniki Warszawskiej|location=Warsaw|isbn=978-83-7207-4|pages=86–87|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
X_{rms} = \sqrt {{1 \over {T}} {\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} {[f(t)]}^2\, dt}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The rectified average is then the mean of the integral of the function's absolute value:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jędrzejewski&quot; /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
X_{arv} = {1 \over {T}} {\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} {|x(t)|\, dt}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[quotient]] of these two values is the form factor, &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt;, or in unambiguous situations, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
k_f = \frac{RMS}{ARV} = \frac{\sqrt {{1 \over {T}} {\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} {[f(t)]}^2\, dt}}}{{1 \over {T}} {\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} {|x(t)|\, dt}}} = \frac{\sqrt{T\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T}{{[f(t)]}^2\, dt}}}{\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} {|x(t)|\, dt}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_{rms}&lt;/math&gt; reflects the variation in the function's distance from the average, and is disproportionately impacted by large deviations from the unrectified average value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)|url=http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/verification/www/english/msg/ver_cont_var/uos3/uos3_ko1.htm|publisher=The European Virtual Organisation for Meteorological Training|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will always be at least as large as &lt;math&gt;X_{arv}&lt;/math&gt;, which only measures the absolute distance from said average. The form factor thus cannot be smaller than 1 (a square wave where all momentary values are equally  far above or below the average value; see below), and has no theoretical upper limit for functions with sufficient deviation.

&lt;math&gt;RMS_{total} = \sqrt{{RMS_1^2} + {RMS_2^2} + ... + {RMS_n^2}}&lt;/math&gt; 

can be used for combining signals of different frequencies&lt;ref name=Two&gt;{{cite web|title=Rms value of two sine waves|url=http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Rms_value_of_sum_of_two_sine_waves|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, for harmonics&lt;ref name=Dusza /&gt;), while for the same frequency, &lt;math&gt;RMS_{total} = RMS_1 + RMS_2 + ... + RMS_n&lt;/math&gt;.

As ARV's on the same domain can be summed as 
&lt;math&gt;ARV_{total} = ARV_1 + ARV_2 + ... + ARV_n&lt;/math&gt;, 
the form factor of a complex wave composed of multiple waves of the same frequency can sometimes be calculated as 

&lt;math&gt;k_{f_{tot}} = \frac{RMS_{tot}}{ARV_{tot}} = \frac{RMS_1 + ... + RMS_n}{ARV_1 + ... + ARV_n}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application ==

Digital AC measuring instruments are often built with specific waveforms in mind. For example, many digital AC multimeters are specifically scaled to display the RMS value of a sine wave. Since the RMS calculation can be difficult to achieve digitally, the absolute average is calculated instead and the result multiplied by the form factor of a sinusoid. This method will give less accurate readings for waveforms other than a sinewave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tanuwijaya|first=Franky|title=True RMS vs AC Average Rectified Multimeter Readings when a Phase Cutting Speed Control is Used|url=http://www.escoglobal.com/resources/pdf/white-papers/True_G2.pdf|publisher=Esco Micro Pte Ltd|accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
As discussed above, the form factor is the quotient of the RMS and the ARV. The independent properties and similarities of these two values define the properties of the form factor.

For example, both RMS and ARV are directly proportional to the [[Amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. However, their division removes the amplitude from the equation, meaning that form factor of a given waveform is the same regardless of how large or small the alternating current or voltage may be.

The squaring in RMS and the absolute value in ARV mean that both the values and the form factor are independent of the wave function's sign (and thus, the electrical signal's direction) at any point. For this reason, the form factor is the same for a direction-changing wave with a regular average of 0 and its fully rectified version.

The form factor, &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt;, is the smallest of the three wave factors, the other two being [[crest factor]] &lt;math&gt;k_a = \frac{X_{max}}{X_{rms}}&lt;/math&gt; and the lesser-known averaging factor &lt;math&gt;k_{av} = \frac{X_{max}}{X_{arv}}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;k_{av} \ge k_a \ge k_f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Dusza /&gt;

Due to their definitions (all relying on the [[Root Mean Square]], [[Average rectified value]] and maximum [[amplitude]] of the waveform), the three factors are related by &lt;math&gt;k_{av} = k_ak_f&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dusza /&gt; so the form factor can be calculated with &lt;math&gt;k_f = \frac{k_{av}}{k_a}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Specific form factors ==
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents the amplitude of the function, and any other coefficients applied in the vertical dimension. For example, &lt;math&gt;8sin(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be analyzed as &lt;math&gt;f(t) = a*sin(t), a = 8&lt;/math&gt;. As both RMS and ARV are directly proportional to it, it has no effect on the form factor, and can be replaced with a normalized 1 for calculating that value.

&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{\tau}{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[duty cycle]], the ratio of the &quot;pulse&quot; time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; (when the function's value is not zero) to the full wave [[Periodic function|period]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Most basic wave functions only achieve 0 for infinitely short instants, and can thus be considered as having &lt;math&gt;\tau = T, D = 1&lt;/math&gt;. However, any of the non-pulsing functions below can be appended with &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{D}}{D} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; 

to allow pulsing. This is illustrated with the half-rectified sine wave, which can be considered a pulsed full-rectified sine wave with &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and has &lt;math&gt;k_f = k_{f_{frs}}\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>Fixed Charge/Discharge equation: Vo -&gt; V_0</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6912">The '''RC time constant''', also called tau, is the [[time constant]] (in [[second]]s) of an [[RC circuit]], is equal to the product of the  circuit resistance(in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]) and the circuit [[capacitance]] (in [[farad]]s), i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt; \tau = R * C &lt;/math&gt;

It is the time required to charge the [[capacitor]], through the [[resistor]], by  ≈ 63.2 percent of the difference between the initial value and final value or discharge the capacitor to ≈36.8 percent. This value is derived from the mathematical constant ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'', specifically &lt;math&gt;1-e^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, more specifically as voltage to charge the capacitor versus time

:Charging  &lt;math&gt; V(t) = V_0(1-e^{-t/ \tau}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capdis.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:Discharging  &lt;math&gt; V(t) = V_0(e^{-t/ \tau}) &lt;/math&gt;


==Cutoff frequency==
The time constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is related to the [[cutoff frequency]] ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, an alternative parameter of the RC circuit, by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = RC = \frac{1}{2 \pi f_c}&lt;/math&gt;
or, equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt;f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C} = \frac{1}{2 \pi \tau}&lt;/math&gt;
where resistance in ohms and capacitance in farads yields the time constant in seconds or the frequency in Hz.

Short conditional equations:
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in Hz = 159155 / &amp;tau; in µs
:&amp;tau; in µs = 159155 / ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in Hz

Other useful equations are:
:rise time (20% to 80%) &lt;math&gt;t_r \approx 1.4 \tau \approx \frac{0.22}{f_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:rise time (10% to 90%) &lt;math&gt;t_r \approx 2.2 \tau \approx \frac{0.35}{f_c}&lt;/math&gt;

In more complicated circuits consisting of more than one resistor and/or capacitor, the [[open-circuit time constant method]] provides a way of approximating the cutoff frequency by computing a sum of several RC time constants.

==Delay==

The signal delay of a wire or other circuit, measured as [[group delay]] or [[phase delay]] or the effective propagation delay of a [[Digital data|digital]] transition, may be dominated by resistive-capacitive effects, depending on the distance and other parameters, or may alternatively be dominated by [[inductance|inductive]], wave, and [[speed of light]] effects in other realms.

Resistive-capacitive delay, or RC delay, hinders the further increasing of speed in [[microelectronics|microelectronic]] [[integrated circuit]]s. When the feature size becomes smaller and smaller to increase the [[clock rate|clock speed]], the RC delay plays an increasingly important role. This delay can be reduced by replacing the [[aluminum]] conducting wire by [[copper]], thus reducing the resistance; it can also be reduced by changing the interlayer [[dielectric]] (typically silicon dioxide) to low-dielectric-constant materials, thus reducing the capacitance.

The typical digital propagation delay of a resistive wire is about half of R times C; since both R and C are proportional to wire length, the delay scales as the square of wire length.  Charge spreads by [[diffusion]] in such a wire, as explained by [[Lord Kelvin]] in the mid nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lord Kelvin | author = Andrew Gray | publisher = Dent | year = 1908 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nmdBauZWa6sC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=intitle:kelvin+diffusion+%22product+of+the+capacity+and+resistance%22+%22square+of+the+length%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until [[Heaviside]] discovered that [[Maxwell's equations]] imply wave propagation when sufficient inductance is in the circuit, this square diffusion relationship was thought to provide a fundamental limit to the improvement of long-distance telegraph cables.  That old analysis was superseded in the telegraph domain, but remains relevant for long on-chip interconnects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = From Obscurity to Enigma | author = Ido Yavetz | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1995 | isbn = 3-7643-5180-2 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=SQszfj7biVMC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=preece+heaviside+telegraph+square#PPA244,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Interconnect-centric Design for Advanced SoC and NoC | author =  Jari Nurmi, Hannu Tenhunen, Jouni Isoaho, and Axel Jantsch | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4020-7835-8 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Uj7RvVE2Ln0C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=vlsi+rc+delay+distributed+diffusion#PPA59,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Analog Electronics Companion | author = Scott Hamilton | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-521-68780-2 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2BntAEtXsBMC&amp;pg=PA580&amp;dq=preece+distributed+heaviside+diffusion+thomson#PPA580,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PWM, 3-level.svg|thumb|right|350px|An example of PWM in an AC motor drive: the phase-to-phase voltage (blue) is modulated as a series of pulses that results in a sine-like flux density waveform (red) in the magnetic circuit of the motor. The smoothness of the resultant waveform can be controlled by the width and number of modulated impulses (per given cycle)]]

'''Pulse-width modulation''' ('''PWM'''), or '''pulse-duration modulation''' ('''PDM'''), is a [[modulation]] technique that conforms the width of the pulse, formally the pulse duration, based on modulator signal information. Although this modulation technique can be used to encode information for transmission, its main use is to allow the control of the power supplied to electrical devices, especially to inertial loads such as motors. In addition, PWM is one of the two principal algorithms used in [[photovoltaic]] solar battery chargers,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/design-installation/sizing-grid-tied-pv-system-battery-backup&lt;/ref&gt; the other being [[MPPT]].

The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the [[Electrical load|load]] is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast pace. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the power supplied to the load is.

The PWM switching frequency has to be much faster than what would affect the load, which is to say the device that uses the power. Typically switchings have to be done several times a minute in an electric stove, 120&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in a lamp dimmer, from few kilohertz (kHz) to tens of kHz for a motor drive and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies.

The term ''[[duty cycle]]'' describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on.

The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle.

PWM has also been used in certain [[Signalling (telecommunication)|communication systems]] where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.

==History==
In the past, when only partial power was needed (such as for a [[sewing machine]] motor), a [[rheostat]] (located in the sewing machine's foot pedal) connected in series with the motor adjusted the amount of current flowing through the motor, but also wasted power as heat in the resistor element. It was an inefficient scheme, but tolerable because the total power was low. This was one of several methods of controlling power. There were others—some still in use—such as variable [[autotransformer]]s, including the [[trademark]]ed 'Autrastat' for theatrical lighting; and the [[Variac]], for general AC power adjustment. These were quite efficient, but also relatively costly.

For about a century, some variable-speed electric motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable power resistors or rotating converter such as [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive]].

However, in addition to motor drives for fans, pumps and [[robotics|robotic]] [[Servomechanism|servos]], there was a great need for compact and low cost means for applying adjustable power for many devices, such as electric stoves and lamp dimmers.

One early application of PWM was in the [[Sinclair Radionics|Sinclair]] X10, a 10&amp;nbsp;W audio amplifier available in kit form in the 1960s. At around the same time PWM started to be used in AC motor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Schönung   | first =A. | coauthors =Stemmler, H. | title =Geregelter Drehstrom-Umkehrantrieb mit gesteuertem Umrichter nach dem Unterschwingungsverfahren | journal =BBC Mitteilungen | volume = 51 | issue = 8/9 | pages =555–577 | publisher =Brown Boveri et Cie | date =August 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
[[Image:Duty cycle general.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 1: a [[pulse wave]], showing the definitions of &lt;math&gt;y_{min}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and D.]]

Pulse-width modulation uses a [[rectangular wave|rectangular pulse wave]] whose pulse width is modulated resulting in the variation of the [[average]] value of the waveform. If we consider a pulse waveform &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, with period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,   low value &lt;math&gt;y_{min}&lt;/math&gt;, a high value &lt;math&gt;y_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[duty cycle]] D (see figure 1), the average value of the waveform is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar y=\frac{1}{T}\int^T_0f(t)\,dt.
&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a pulse wave, its value is &lt;math&gt;y_{max}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;t&lt;D\cdot T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{min}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;D\cdot T &lt;t&lt;T&lt;/math&gt;. The above expression then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\bar y =\frac{1}{T}\left(\int_0^{DT}y_{max}\,dt+\int_{DT}^T y_{min}\,dt\right)\\

= \frac{D\cdot T\cdot y_{max}+ T\left(1-D\right)y_{min}}{T}\\

= D\cdot y_{max}+ \left(1-D\right)y_{min}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This latter expression can be fairly simplified in many cases where &lt;math&gt;y_{min}=0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\bar y=D\cdot y_{max}&lt;/math&gt;. From this, it is obvious that the average value of the signal (&lt;math&gt;\bar y&lt;/math&gt;) is directly dependent on the duty cycle D.

[[Image:Pwm.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 2: A simple method to generate the PWM pulse train corresponding to a given signal is the intersective PWM: the signal (here the red sinewave) is compared with a sawtooth waveform (blue). When the latter is less than the former, the PWM signal (magenta) is in high state (1). Otherwise it is in the low state (0).]]

The simplest way to generate a PWM signal is the intersective method, which requires only a [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] or a [[Triangle wave|triangle]] waveform (easily generated using a simple [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]) and a [[comparator]]. When the value of the reference signal (the red sine wave in figure 2) is more than the modulation waveform (blue), the PWM signal (magenta) is in the high state, otherwise it is in the low state.

===Delta===

{{Main|Delta modulation}}

In the use of delta modulation for PWM control, the output signal is integrated, and the result is compared with limits, which correspond to a Reference signal offset by a constant. Every time the integral of the output signal reaches one of the limits, the PWM signal changes state. Figure 3
[[Image:Delta PWM.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 3 : Principle of the delta PWM. The output signal (blue) is compared with the limits (green). These limits correspond to the reference signal (red), offset by a given value. Every time the output signal (blue) reaches one of the limits, the PWM signal changes state.]]

===Delta-sigma===

{{Main|Delta-sigma modulation}}

In delta-sigma modulation as a PWM control method, the output signal is subtracted from a reference signal to form an error signal. This error is integrated, and when the integral of the error exceeds the limits, the output changes state. Figure 4
[[Image:Sigma-delta PWM.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 4 : Principle of the sigma-delta PWM. The top green waveform is the reference signal, on which the output signal (PWM, in the bottom plot) is subtracted to form the error signal (blue, in top plot). This error is integrated (middle plot), and when the integral of the error exceeds the limits (red lines), the output changes state.]]

===Space vector modulation===

{{Main|Space vector modulation}}

Space vector modulation is a PWM control algorithm for multi-phase AC generation, in which the reference signal is sampled regularly; after each sample, non-zero active switching vectors adjacent to the reference vector and one or more of the zero switching vectors are selected for the appropriate fraction of the sampling period in order to synthesize the reference signal as the average of the used vectors.

===Direct torque control (DTC)===

{{Main|Direct torque control}}

Direct torque control is a method used to control AC motors. It is closely related with the delta modulation (see above). Motor torque and magnetic flux are estimated and these are controlled to stay within their hysteresis bands by turning on new combination of the device's semiconductor switches each time either of the signal tries to deviate out of the band.

===Time proportioning===

Many digital circuits can generate PWM signals (e.g., many [[microcontrollers]] have PWM outputs). They normally use a [[counter]] that increments periodically (it is connected directly or indirectly to the [[clock signal|clock]] of the circuit) and is reset at the end of every period of the PWM. When the counter value is more than the reference value, the PWM output changes state from high to low (or low to high).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netrino.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/PWM-Pulse-Width-Modulation www.netrino.com&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Introduction to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is referred to as '''time proportioning,''' particularly as '''time-proportioning control'''&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of HVAC Control Systems,'' by Robert McDowall, [http://books.google.com/books?id=UMk1EUp-W-UC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22time+proportioning%22 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt; – which ''proportion'' of a fixed [[cycle time]] is spent in the high state.

The incremented and periodically reset counter is the discrete version of the intersecting method's sawtooth. The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, as a function of the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.

===Types===
[[Image:Three PWM types.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 5 : Three types of PWM signals (blue): leading edge modulation (top), trailing edge modulation (middle) and centered pulses (both edges are modulated, bottom). The green lines are the sawtooth waveform (first and second cases) and a triangle waveform (third case) used to generate the PWM waveforms using the intersective method.]]

Three types of pulse-width modulation (PWM) are possible:
#The pulse center may be fixed in the center of the time window and both [[signal edge|edges]] of the pulse moved to compress or expand the width.
#The lead edge can be held at the lead edge of the window and the tail edge modulated.
#The tail edge can be fixed and the lead edge modulated.

===Spectrum===
The resulting [[spectrum|spectra]] (of the three cases) are similar, and each contains a [[Direct current|dc]] component, a base sideband containing the modulating signal and phase modulated [[Carrier wave|carriers]] at each [[harmonic]] of the  frequency of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a &lt;math&gt;\sin x / x&lt;/math&gt; envelope ([[sinc function]]) and extend to infinity.
The infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from [[aliasing]] distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern [[communications systems|communications system]]. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hausmair|first=Katharina|coauthors=Shuli Chi, Peter Singerl, Christian Vogel|title=Aliasing-Free Digital Pulse-Width Modulation for Burst-Mode RF Transmitters|journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers|date=February 2013|volume=60|issue=2|pages=415–427|doi=10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, the delta modulation is a random process that produces continuous spectrum without distinct harmonics.

===PWM sampling theorem===
The process of PWM conversion is non-linear and it is generally supposed that low pass filter signal recovery is imperfect for PWM. The PWM sampling theorem&lt;ref&gt;J. Huang, K. Padmanabhan, and O. M. Collins, “The sampling theorem with constant amplitude variable width pulses”, IEEE transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 58, pp. 1178 - 1190, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that PWM conversion can be perfect. The theorem states that &quot;Any bandlimited baseband signal within ±0.637 can be represented by a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform with unit amplitude. The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level.&quot;

==Applications==

===Telecommunications===
{{main|servo control}}
In [[telecommunications]], PWM  is a form of signal [[modulation#Pulse_modulation_methods|modulation]] where the widths of the pulses correspond to specific data values encoded at one end and decoded at the other.

Pulses of various lengths (the information itself) will be sent at regular intervals (the [[Carrier wave|carrier frequency]] of the modulation).

The inclusion of a [[clock signal]] is not necessary, as the leading edge of the data signal can be used as the clock if a small offset is added to the data value in order to avoid a data value with a zero length pulse.

===Power delivery===
PWM can be used to control the amount of power delivered to a load without incurring the losses that would result from linear power delivery by resistive means. Potential drawbacks to this technique are the pulsations defined by the duty cycle, switching frequency and properties of the load. With a sufficiently high switching frequency and, when necessary, using additional passive [[electronic filter]]s, the pulse train can be smoothed and average analog waveform recovered.

High [[frequency]] PWM power control systems are easily realisable with semiconductor switches. As explained above, almost no power is dissipated by the switch in either on or off state. However, during the transitions between on and off states, both voltage and current are nonzero and thus power is dissipated in the switches. By quickly changing the state between fully on and fully off (typically less than 100 nanoseconds), the power dissipation in the switches can be quite low compared to the power being delivered to the load.

Modern semiconductor switches such as [[MOSFET]]s or [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) are well suited components for high efficiency controllers. Frequency converters used to control AC motors may have efficiencies exceeding 98%. Switching power supplies have lower efficiency due to low output voltage levels (often even less than 2 V for microprocessors are needed) but still more than 70–80% efficiency can be achieved.

Variable-speed fan controllers for computers usually use PWM, as it is far more efficient when compared to a [[potentiometer]] or [[rheostat]]. (Neither of the latter is practical to operate electronically; they would require a small drive motor.)

Light dimmers for home use employ a specific type of PWM control. Home-use light dimmers typically include electronic circuitry which suppresses current flow during defined portions of each cycle of the AC line voltage. Adjusting the brightness of light emitted by a light source is then merely a matter of setting at what voltage (or phase) in the AC halfcycle the dimmer begins to provide electrical current to the light source (e.g. by using an electronic switch such as a [[TRIAC|triac]]). In this case the PWM duty cycle is the ratio of the conduction time to the duration of the half AC cycle defined by the frequency of the AC line voltage (50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz depending on the country).

These rather simple types of dimmers can be effectively used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light sources such as incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which is caused by the dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low frequency drive voltages. Perceivable flicker effects from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid, the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker (see [[flicker fusion threshold]]).

In electric cookers, continuously variable power is applied to the heating elements such as the hob or the grill using a device known as a [[Energy regulator|Simmerstat]]. This consists of a thermal oscillator running at approximately two cycles per minute and the mechanism varies the duty cycle according to the knob setting. The thermal time constant of the heating elements is several minutes, so that the temperature fluctuations are too small to matter in practice.

===Voltage regulation===
{{Main|Switched-mode power supply}}

PWM is also used in efficient [[voltage regulator]]s. By switching voltage to the load with the appropriate duty cycle, the output will approximate a voltage at the desired level. The switching noise is usually filtered with an [[inductor]] and a [[capacitor]].

One method measures the output voltage. When it is lower than the desired voltage, it turns on the switch. When the output voltage is above the desired voltage, it turns off the switch.

===Audio effects and amplification===
PWM is sometimes used in sound (music) synthesis, in particular [[subtractive synthesis]], as it gives a sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM is equivalent to the difference of two [[sawtooth wave]]s with one of them inverted.[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/synthsecrets47.asp]) The ratio between the high and low level is typically modulated with a [[low frequency oscillation|low frequency oscillator]]. In addition, varying the duty cycle of a pulse waveform in a subtractive-synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) was distinctive, because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the [[Video game music|soundtracks of classic video games]].

A new class of audio amplifiers based on the PWM principle is becoming popular. Called &quot;[[Class-D amplifier]]s&quot;, they produce a PWM equivalent of the analog input signal which is fed to the [[loudspeaker]] via a suitable filter network to block the carrier and recover the original audio. These amplifiers are characterized by very good efficiency figures (≥ 90%) and compact size/light weight for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving [[Servomotor|servo motors]]. Field-gradient coils in [[MRI]] machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.

Historically, a crude form of PWM has been used to play back PCM digital sound on the [[PC speaker]], which is driven by only two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V. By carefully timing the duration of the pulses, and by relying on the speaker's physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.) it was possible to obtain an approximate playback of mono PCM samples, although at a very low quality, and with greatly varying results between implementations.

In more recent times, the [[Direct Stream Digital]] sound encoding method was introduced, which uses a generalized form of pulse-width modulation called [[pulse density modulation]], at a high enough sampling rate (typically in the order of MHz) to cover the whole [[Acoustics|acoustic]] frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.

===Electrical===
SPWM (Sine–triangle pulse width modulation) signals are used in micro-inverter design (used in solar or wind power applications). These switching signals are fed to the FETs that are used in the device. The device's efficiency depends on the harmonic content of the PWM signal. There is much research on eliminating unwanted harmonics and improving the fundamental strength, some of which involves using a modified carrier signal instead of a classic sawtooth signal &lt;ref&gt;Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, “A Harmonically Superior Modulator with Wide Baseband and Real-Time Tunability”, IEEE International Symposium on Electronic Design (ISED), India, Dec.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, “Real Time Harmonic Elimination Using a Modified Carrier”, CONIELECOMP, Mexico, Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, “A Novel Strategy for Selective Harmonic Elimination Based on a Sine-Sine PWM Model”, MWSCAS, U.S.A, Aug 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to decrease power losses and improve efficiency. Another common application is in robotics where PWM signals are used to control the speed of the robot by controlling the motors.

[[File:Elektronikdruck.jpg|thumb|Gravure printing of electronic structures on paper.]]
'''Printed electronics''' is a set of [[printing]] methods used to create electrical devices on various substrates.  Printing typically uses common printing equipment or other low-cost equipment suitable for defining patterns on material, such as [[screen printing]], [[flexography]], [[gravure]], [[offset lithography]], and [[inkjet]].  Electrically functional electronic or optical inks are deposited on the substrate, creating active or passive devices, such as [[thin film transistors]] or [[resistors]]. Printed electronics is expected to facilitate widespread, very low-cost, low-performance electronics for applications such as [[flexible display]]s, [[smart labels]], decorative and animated posters, and active clothing that do not require high performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coa09&quot;&gt;
Coatanéa, E., Kantola, V., Kulovesi, J., Lahti, L., Lin, R., &amp; Zavodchikova, M. (2009). Printed Electronics, Now and Future. In Neuvo, Y., &amp; Ylönen, S. (eds.), Bit Bang – Rays to the Future. Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), MIDE, Helsinki University Print, Helsinki, Finland, 63-102. ISBN 978-952-248-078-1. http://lib.tkk.fi/Reports/2009/isbn9789522480781.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''printed electronics'' is related to [[organic electronics]] or [[plastic electronics]], in which one or more inks are composed of carbon-based compounds. These other terms refer to the ink material, which can be deposited by solution-based, vacuum-based  or some other method. Printed electronics, in contrast, specifies the process, and can utilize any solution-based material, including [[organic semiconductor]]s, [[inorganic]] [[semiconductor]]s, metallic conductors, [[nanoparticles]], [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], etc.

For the preparation of printed electronics nearly all industrial printing methods are employed.  Similar to conventional printing, printed electronics applies ink layers one atop another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rot01&quot;&gt;
H.-K. Roth et al., Materialwissenschaft und Werkstofftechnik 32 (2001) 789.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the coherent development of printing methods and ink materials are the field's essential tasks.

The most important benefit of printing is low-cost volume fabrication. The lower cost enables use in more applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu00&quot;&gt;
J.M. Xu, Synthetic Metals 115 (2000) 1.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is [[RFID]]-systems, which enable contactless identification in trade and transport. In some domains, such as [[light-emitting diodes]] printing does not impact performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rot01&quot;/&gt;  Printing on flexible substrates allows electronics to be placed on curved surfaces, for example, putting solar cells on vehicle roofs. More typically, conventional semiconductors justify their much higher costs by providing much higher performance.

[[Image:ComplementaryTechnologies.png|thumb|Printed and conventional electronics as complementary technologies.]]

==Resolution, registration, thickness, holes, materials==
The maximum required resolution of structures in conventional printing is determined by the human eye. Feature sizes smaller than approximately 20&amp;nbsp;µm cannot be distinguished by the human eye and consequently exceed the capabilities of conventional printing processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bla05&quot;&gt;
A. Blayo and B. Pineaux, Joint sOC-EUSAI Conference, Grenoble, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, higher resolution and smaller structures are necessary in much electronics printing, because they directly affect  circuit density and functionality (especially transistors). A similar requirement holds for the precision with which layers are printed on top of each other (layer to layer registration).

Control of thickness, holes, and material compatibility (wetting, adhesion, solvation) are essential, but matter in conventional printing only if the eye can detect them. Conversely, the visual impression is irrelevant for printed electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fug06&quot;&gt;
U. Fügmann et al., mstNews 2 (2006) 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing technologies==
The attraction of printing technology for the fabrication of electronics mainly results from the possibility of preparing stacks of micro-structured layers (and thereby thin-film devices) in a much simpler and cost-effective way compared to conventional electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;She04&quot;&gt;
J.R. Sheats, Journal of Materials Research 19 (2004) 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the ability to implement new or improved functionalities (e.g. mechanical flexibility) plays a role. The selection of the printing method used is determined by requirements concerning printed layers, by the properties of printed materials as well as economic and technical considerations of the final printed products.

Printing technologies divide between sheet-based and [[roll-to-roll]]-based approaches. Sheet-based [[inkjet]] and screen printing are best for low-volume, high-precision work. [[Gravure]], [[offset printing|offset]] and [[flexography|flexographic printing]] are more common for high-volume production, such as solar cells, reaching 10.000 square meters per hour (m²/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bla05&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;She04&quot;/&gt; While offset and flexographic printing are mainly used for inorganic&lt;ref name=&quot;Har02&quot;&gt;

A. Hübler et al., Organic Electronics 8 (2007) 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gravure]] printing is especially suitable for quality-sensitive layers like organic semiconductors and semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces in transistors, due to high layer quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hub07&quot;/&gt; In connection with high resolution, is also suitable for inorganic&lt;ref name=&quot;Lep94&quot;&gt;
S. Leppavuori et al., Sensors and Actuators 41-42 (1994) 593.&lt;/ref&gt; and organic&lt;ref name=&quot;Mak03&quot;&gt;
T. Mäkelä et al., Synthetic Metals 135 (2003) 41.&lt;/ref&gt; conductors. Organic [[field-effect transistors]] and [[integrated circuit]]s can be prepared completely by means of mass-printing methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hub07&quot;/&gt;

Inkjets are flexible and versatile, and can be set up with relatively low effort. Inkjets are probably the most commonly used method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Par05&quot;&gt;
R. Parashkov et al., Proceedings IEEE 93 (2005) 1321.&lt;/ref&gt; However, inkjets offer lower througput of around 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h and lower resolution (ca. 50&amp;nbsp;µm).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bla05&quot;/&gt; It is well suited for low-[[viscosity]], soluble materials like organic semiconductors. With high-viscosity materials, like organic dielectrics, and  dispersed particles, like inorganic metal inks, difficulties due to nozzle clogging occur. Because ink is deposited via droplets, thickness and dispersion homogeneity is reduced. Simultaneously using many nozzles and pre-structuring the substrate allows improvements in productivity and resolution, respectively. However, in the latter case non-printing methods must be employed for the actual patterning step.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gan04&quot;&gt;
B.-J. de Gans et al., Advanced Materials 16 (2004) 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Inkjet printing is preferable for organic semiconductors in [[OFET|organic field-effect transistors]] (OFETs) and [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs), but also OFETs completely prepared by this method have been demonstrated.&lt;!-- this is illogical--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sub05&quot;&gt;

Screen printing is appropriate for fabricating electrics and electronics due to its ability to produce patterned, thick layers from paste-like materials. This method can produce conducting lines from inorganic materials (e.g. for circuit boards and antennas), but also insulating and passivating layers, whereby layer thickness is more important than high resolution. Its 50 m²/h throughput and 100&amp;nbsp;µm resolution are similar to inkjets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bla05&quot;/&gt; This versatile and comparatively simple method is used mainly for conductive and dielectric layers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boc05&quot;&gt;

S.E. Shaheen et al., Applied Physics Letters 79 (2001) 2996.&lt;/ref&gt; and even complete OFETs&lt;ref name=&quot;Hol01&quot;/&gt; can be printed.

Aerosol Jet Printing (also known as Maskless Mesoscale Materials Deposition or M3D)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ren12&quot;&gt;M. Renn, US Patent number 7,485,345 B2. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; is another material deposition technology for printed electronics. The Aerosol Jet process begins with atomization of an ink, which can be heated up to 80&amp;nbsp;°C, producing droplets on the order of one to two micrometres in diameter. The atomized droplets are entrained in a gas stream and delivered to the print head. Here, an annular flow of clean gas is introduced around the aerosol stream to focus the droplets into a tightly collimated beam of material. The combined gas streams exit the print head through a converging nozzle that compresses the aerosol stream to a diameter as small as 10&amp;nbsp;µm. The jet of droplets exits the print head at high velocity (~50 meters/second) and impinges upon the substrate. Electrical interconnects, passive and active components&lt;ref name=&quot;Cho08&quot;&gt;J.H. Cho et al, Nature Materials, 19 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; are formed by moving the print head, equipped with a mechanical stop/start shutter, relative to the substrate. The resulting patterns can have features ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;µm wide, with layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to &gt;10&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kha07&quot;&gt;B. Kahn, Organic and Printed Electronics, Volume 1, Issue 2 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; A wide nozzle print head enables efficient patterning of millimeter size electronic features and surface coating applications. All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers and at room temperature. The high exit velocity of the jet enables a relatively large separation between the print head and the substrate, typically 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm. The droplets remain tightly focused over this distance, resulting in the ability to print conformal patterns over three dimensional substrates. Despite the high velocity, the printing process is gentle; substrate damage does not occur and there is generally no splatter or overspray from the droplets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kin09&quot;&gt;B. H. King et al, Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), 2009 34th IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; Once patterning is complete, the printed ink typically requires post treatment to attain final electrical and mechanical properties. Post-treatment is driven more by the specific ink and substrate combination than by the printing process. A wide range of materials has been successfully deposited with the Aerosol Jet process, including diluted thick film pastes, thermosetting polymers such as UV-curable epoxies, and solvent-based polymers like polyurethane and polyimide, and biologic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gru10&quot;&gt;Ingo Grunwald et al 2010 Biofabrication 2 014106).&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaporation printing uses a combination of high precision screen printing with material vaporization to print features to 5&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]. This method uses techniques such as thermal, e-beam, sputter and other traditional production technologies to deposit materials through a high precision shadow mask (or stencil) that is registered to the substrate to better than 1 micrometer. By layering different mask designs and/or adjusting materials, reliable, cost-effective circuits can be built additively, without the use of photolithography, on a production scale that is larger and more efficient than traditional printed electronic technologies.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Other methods with similarities to printing, among them [[microcontact printing]] and [[nanoimprint lithography|nano-imprint lithography]] are of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gat05&quot;&gt;
B.D. Gate et al., Chemical Reviews 105 (2005) 1171.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, µm- and nm-sized layers, respectively, are prepared by methods similar to stamping with soft and hard forms, respectively. Often the actual structures are prepared subtractively, e.g. by deposition of etch masks or by lift-off processes. For example electrodes for OFETs can be prepared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li06&quot;&gt;
D. Li and L.J. Guo, Applied Physics Letters 88 (2006) 063513.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lei06&quot;&gt;
G. Leising et al., Microelectronics Engineering 83 (2006) 831.&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadically [[pad printing]] is used in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kno04&quot;&gt;
A. Knobloch et al., Journal of Applied Physics 96 (2004) 2286.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally so-called transfer methods, where solid layers are transferred from a carrier to the substrate, are considered printed electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hin07&quot;&gt;
D.R. Hines et al., Journal of Applied Physics 101 (2007) 024503.&lt;/ref&gt; [[xerography|Electrophotography]] is currently not used in printed electronics.

==Materials==
Both organic and inorganic materials are used for printed electronics. Ink materials must be available in liquid form, for solution, dispersion or suspension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bao00&quot;&gt;
Z. Bao, Advanced Materials 12 (2000) 227.&lt;/ref&gt; They must function as conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, or insulators. Material costs must be fit for the application.

Electronic functionality and printability can interfere with each other, mandating careful optimization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fug06&quot;/&gt; For example, a higher molecular weight in polymers enhances conductivity, but diminishes solubility. For printing, viscosity, surface tension and solid content must be tightly controlled. Cross-layer interactions such as wetting, adhesion, and solubility as well as post-deposition drying procedures affect the outcome. Additives often used in conventional printing inks are unavailable, because they often defeat electronic functionality.

Material properties largely determine the differences between printed and conventional electronics. Printable materials provide decisive advantages beside printability, such as mechanical flexibility and functional adjustment by chemical modification (e.g. light color in OLEDs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mol04&quot;&gt;
Moliton and R.C. Hiorns, Polymer International 53 (2004) 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printed conductors offer lower conductivity and charge carrier mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nob00&quot;/&gt;

With a few exceptions, inorganic ink materials are dispersions of metallic or semiconducting micro- and nano-particles. Semiconducting nanoparticles used include silicon &lt;ref name=&quot;Bri06&quot;&gt;D.T. Britton and M. Härting, Pure and Applied Chemistry 78 (2006) 1723 - 1739, http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac200678091723&lt;/ref&gt; and oxide semiconductors.&lt;ref name =&quot;Fab09&quot;&gt;H. Faber et al, Advanced Materials 29(2009)3099.&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon is also printed as an organic precursor &lt;ref name =&quot;Shi06&quot;&gt;T. Shimoda et al, Nature 440 (2006) 783 - 786.&lt;/ref&gt; which is then converted by pyrolisis and annealing into crystalline silicon.

===Organic materials===
Organic printed electronics integrates knowledge and developments from printing, electronics, chemistry, and materials science, especially from organic and polymer chemistry. Organic materials in part differ from conventional electronics in terms of structure, operation and functionality,&lt;ref name=&quot;Var05&quot;&gt;
Z.V. Vardeny et al., Synthetic Metals 148 (2005) 1.&lt;/ref&gt; which influences device and circuit design and optimization as well as fabrication method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kem01&quot;&gt;H. Kempa et al., it 3 (2008) 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[conductive polymer|conjugated polymers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Nob00&quot;&gt;
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/chemadv.pdf Nobel prize in chemistry, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  and their development into soluble materials provided the first organic ink materials. Materials from this class of polymers variously possess [[electrical conduction|conducting]], [[semiconductor|semiconducting]], [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]], [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] and other properties. Other polymers are used mostly as [[insulator (electrical)|insulators and dielectrics]].

In most organic materials, hole transport is favored over electron transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fac07&quot;&gt;
Fachetti, Materials Today 10 (2007) 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies indicate that this is a specific feature of organic semiconductor/dielectric-interfaces, which play a major role in OFETs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zau07&quot;&gt;
J. Zaumseil and H. Sirringhaus, Chemical Reviews 107 (2007) 1296.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore p-type devices should dominate over n-type devices. Durability (resistance to dispersion) and lifetime is less than conventional materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee97&quot;&gt;
D.M. de Leeuw et al., Synthetic Metals 87 (1997) 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic semiconductors include the conductive [[polymer]]s poly(3,4-ethylene dioxitiophene), doped with poly([[styrene]] [[sulfonate]]), ([[PEDOT:PSS]]) and poly([[aniline]]) (PANI). Both polymers are commercially available in different formulations and have been printed using inkjet,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bha06&quot;&gt;
J. Bharathan and Y. Yang, Applied Physics Letters 72 (2006) 2660.&lt;/ref&gt; screen&lt;ref name=&quot;Boc05&quot;/&gt; and offset printing&lt;ref name=&quot;Zie05&quot;/&gt; or screen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boc05&quot;/&gt; flexo&lt;ref name=&quot;Mak05&quot;/&gt; and gravure&lt;ref name=&quot;Mak03&quot;/&gt; printing, respectively.

Polymer semiconductors are processed using inkjet printing, such as [[polythiophene|poly(thiopene)s]] like poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)&lt;ref name=&quot;Spe01&quot;&gt;
S.P. Speakman et al., Organic Electronics 2 (2001) 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene co-bithiophen) (F8T2).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pau03&quot;&gt;
K.E. Paul et al., Applied Physics Letters 83 (2003) 2070.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter material has also been gravure printed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hub07&quot;/&gt; Different electroluminescent polymers are used with inkjet printing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gan04&quot;/&gt; as well as active materials for [[photovoltaic]]s (e.g. blends of P3HT with [[fullerene]] derivatives),&lt;ref name=&quot;Aer08&quot;&gt;
T. Aernouts et al., Applied Physics Letters 92 (2008) 033306.&lt;/ref&gt; which in part also can be deposited using screen printing (e.g. blends of [[poly(p-phenylene vinylene)|poly(phenylene vinylene)]] with fullerene derivatives).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sha01a&quot;/&gt;

Printable organic and inorganic insulators and dielectrics exist, which can be processed with different printing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ion Gel Insulator|url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Ion-Gel-as-a-Gate-Insulator-in-Field-Effect-Transistors__Z07062.aspx}}{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inorganic materials===
Inorganic electronics provides highly ordered layers and interfaces that organic and polymer materials cannot provide.

[[Silver]] nanoparticles are used with flexo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sid05&quot;/&gt; offset &lt;ref name=&quot;Har00&quot;/&gt; and inkjet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Per06&quot;&gt;J. Perelaer et al., Advanced Materials 18 (2006) 2101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold]] particles are used with inkjet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noh07&quot;&gt;Y.-Y. Noh et al., Nature Nanotechnology 2 (2007) 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

A.C. [[electroluminescent]] (EL) multi-color displays can cover many tens of square meters, or be incorporated in watch faces and instrument displays. They involve six to eight printed inorganic layers, including a copper doped phosphor, on a plastic film substrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;packagingessentials.com&quot;&gt;
Mflex UK (formerly Pelikon) and elumin8, both in the UK, Emirates Technical Innovation Centre in Dubai, [[Schreiner]] in Germany and others are involved in EL displays.  Spectrolab already offers commercially flexible solar cells based on various inorganic compounds. [http://www.packagingessentials.com/indnews.asp?id=2007-03-22-15.57.31.000000]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon inks are used commercially in transistor circuits for RFID labels,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} selective emitters and dopant layers for photovoltaics,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and temperature sensors.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Fully printed field effect transistors produced at room temperature using silicon nanoparticles have been demonstrated,&lt;ref name =&quot;Har09&quot;&gt;M. Härting et al, Applied Physics Letters 94(2009)
193509, http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3126958&lt;/ref&gt; but the field effect mobility is low compared to crystalline silicon (being similar to that obtained in amorphous silicon transistors). In printed nanoparticle silicon, the low mobility arises from an activated charge transport between nanoparticles, which in turn enables its use as a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor material.&lt;ref name = &quot;Man13&quot;&gt;U. Männl et al, Japanese Journal of Physics 52 (2013) UNSP 05DA11, http://dx.doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.52.05DA11.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding varistor characteristics have recently been used to develop a current switching transistor,&lt;ref name = &quot;Bri13&quot;&gt;D.T. Britton et al, AIP Advances  3 (2013) 082110, http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4818275&lt;/ref&gt; which works as a two-way switch by changing the conductivity between the different pairs of terminals.
  
[[CIGS cell]]s can be printed directly onto [[molybdenum]] [[coating|coated]] [[glass sheet]]s.

A printed [[gallium arsenide germanium solar cell]] demonstrated 40.7% conversion efficiency, eight times that of the best organic cells, approaching the best performance of crystalline silicon.&lt;ref name=&quot;packagingessentials.com&quot;/&gt;

===Substrates===
Printed electronics allows the use of flexible substrates, which lowers production costs and allows fabrication of mechanically flexible circuits. While inkjet and screen printing typically imprint rigid substrates like glass and silicon, mass-printing methods nearly exclusively use flexible foil and paper.  [[polyethylene terephthalate|Poly(ethylene terephthalate)]]-foil (PET) is a common choice, due to its low cost and higher temperature stability. [[Polyethylene naphthalate|Poly(ethylene naphthalate)]]- (PEN) and [[polyimide|poly(imide)]]-foil (PI) are alternatives.  [[Paper]]'s low costs and manifold applications make it an attractive substrate, however, its high roughness and large absorbency make it problematic for electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Har00&quot;&gt;
P.M. Harrey et al., Journal of Electronics Manufacturing 10 (2000) 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important substrate criteria are low roughness and suitable wettability, which can be tuned pre-treatment (coating, [[corona poling|corona]]). In contrast to conventional printing, high absorbency is usually disadvantageous.

==Applications==
Printed electronics are in use or under consideration for:

* [[Radio frequency identification]] (RFID) tags
* Monitoring
* Data storage
* Display and visual effects
* Toys

Norwegian company [[Thin Film Electronics ASA|ThinFilm]] successfully demonstrated roll-to-roll printed organic memory in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsworld.com/articles/winners_of_the_idtechex_printed_electronics_europe_awards_00001368.asp Thinfilm and InkTec awarded IDTechEx' Technical Development Manufacturing Award] IDTechEx, April 15th 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4084606/PolyIC-ThinFilm-announce-pilot-of-volume-printed-plastic-memories PolyIC, ThinFilm announce pilot of volume printed plastic memories] EETimes, September 22nd 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsworld.com/articles/all_set_for_high_volume_production_of_printed_memories_00002179.asp All set for high-volume production of printed memories] Printed Electronics World, April 12th 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2010/05/thin-film-electronics-plans-to-provide-memory-ever Thin Film Electronics Plans to Provide ‘Memory Everywhere’] Printed Electronics Now, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards development and activities==
[[Technical standard]]s and roadmapping initiatives are intended to facilitate [[value chain]] development (for sharing of product specifications, [[characterization]] standards, etc.) This strategy of standards development mirrors the approach used by silicon-based electronics over the past 50 years.  Initiatives include:
* The [[IEEE Standards Association]] has published [[IEEE]] 1620-2004&lt;ref&gt;

'''Electrical resonance''' occurs in an [[electrical network|electric circuit]] at a particular ''[[Resonance|resonance frequency]]'' when the imaginary parts of [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] or [[admittance]]s of circuit elements cancel each other.  In some circuits this happens when the impedance between the input and output of the circuit is almost zero and the [[transfer function]] is close to one.

Resonant circuits exhibit ringing and can generate higher voltages and currents than are fed into them. They are widely used in [[wireless]] ([[radio]]) transmission for both transmission and reception.

==LC circuits==
{{main|LC circuit}}
Resonance of a circuit involving [[capacitors]] and [[inductors]] occurs because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic field in the inductor. This process is repeated continually. An analogy is a mechanical [[pendulum]].

At resonance, the series [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the two elements is at a minimum and the parallel impedance is at maximum. Resonance is used for [[tuned filter|tuning]] and filtering, because it occurs at a particular [[frequency]] for given values of [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]]. It can be detrimental to the operation of [[telecommunications|communications]] circuits by causing unwanted sustained and transient oscillations that may cause [[noise]], signal [[distortion]], and damage to circuit elements.

Parallel resonance or near-to-resonance circuits can be used to prevent the waste of electrical energy, which would otherwise occur while the inductor built its field or the capacitor charged and discharged. As an example, asynchronous motors waste inductive current while synchronous ones waste capacitive current. The use of the two types in parallel makes the inductor feed the capacitor, and ''vice versa'', maintaining the same resonant current in the circuit, and converting all the current into useful work.

Since the inductive [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] and the capacitive reactance are of equal magnitude, ω''L'' = 1/ω''C'', so:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ω = 2π''f'', in which ''f'' is the resonance frequency in [[hertz]], ''L'' is the inductance in [[henry (unit)|henries]], and ''C'' is the capacitance in [[farad]]s when standard [[SI unit]]s are used.

The quality of the resonance (how long it will ring when excited) is determined by its [[Q factor]], which is a function of resistance. A true LC circuit would have infinite Q, but all real circuits have some resistance and smaller Q and are usually approximated more accurately by an RLC circuit.

==RLC circuit==
{{main|RLC circuit}}
[[File:RLC series.png|thumb|350px|A series RLC circuit: a resistor, inductor, and a capacitor]]
An '''RLC circuit'''  (or '''LCR circuit''') is an [[electrical circuit]] consisting of a [[resistor]], an [[inductor]], and a [[capacitor]], connected in series or in parallel.  The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] respectively.  The circuit forms a [[harmonic oscillator]] for current and [[resonance|resonates]] similarly to an [[LC circuit]].  The main difference stemming from the presence of the resistor is that any oscillation induced in the circuit decays over time if it is not kept going by a source.  This effect of the resistor is called [[damping]]. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency.  Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component.  A pure LC circuit is an ideal that only exists in theory.

There are many applications for this circuit. It is used in many different types of [[electronic oscillator|oscillator circuits]].  An important application is for [[tuner (electronics)|tuning]], such as in [[receiver (radio)|radio receivers]] or [[television set]]s, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves.  In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit.  An RLC circuit can be used as a [[band-pass filter]], [[band-stop filter]], [[low-pass filter]] or [[high-pass filter]].  The tuning application, for instance, is an example of band-pass filtering.  The RLC filter is described as a ''second-order'' circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order [[differential equation]] in circuit analysis.

The three circuit elements can be combined in a number of different [[topology (electronics)|topologies]].  All three elements in series or all three elements in parallel are the simplest in concept and the most straightforward to analyse.  There are, however, other arrangements, some with practical importance in real circuits.  One issue often encountered is the need to take into account inductor resistance.  Inductors are typically constructed from coils of wire, the resistance of which is not usually desirable, but it often has a significant effect on the circuit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">'''Responsivity'''  measures the input–output [[gain]] of a detector system. In the specific case of a [[photodetector]], responsivity measures the electrical [[output]] per optical input. 

The responsivity of a photodetector is usually expressed in units of either [[ampere]]s or [[volt]]s per [[watt]] of incident [[radiant flux|radiant power]]. For a system that responds [[linear]]ly to its input, there is a unique responsivity.  For [[nonlinear system]]s, the responsivity is the local slope (derivative). Many common photodetectors respond linearly as a function of the incident power.  

Responsivity is a function of the [[wavelength]] of the incident [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] and of the sensor properties, such as the [[bandgap]] of the material of which the photodetector is made. One simple expression for the responsivity ''R'' of a photodetector in which an optical signal is converted into an electrical current (known as a [[photocurrent]]) is 

&lt;math&gt;R=\eta\frac{q}{hf}\approx\eta\frac{\lambda_{(\mu m)}}{1.23985(\mu m\times W/A)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum efficiency]] (the conversion efficiency of photons to electrons) of the detector for a given wavelength, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the optical signal, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Multielement Detection Systems for Spectrochemical Analysis | author = Kenneth W. Busch, Marianna A. Busch | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-471-81974-3

The term responsivity is also used to summarize input–output relationship in non-electrical systems. For example, a neuroscientist may measure how neurons in the visual pathway respond to light.  In this case, responsivity summarizes the change in the neural response per unit signal strength. The responsivity in these applications can have a variety of units. The signal strength typically is controlled by varying either intensity (intensity-response function) or contrast (contrast-response function).  The neural response measure depends on the part of the nervous system under study.  For example, at the level of the retinal cones, the response might be in photocurrent. In the central nervous system the response is usually spikes per second. In functional neuroimaging, the response measure is usually BOLD contrast.  The responsivity units reflect the relevant stimulus and physiological units. 

When describing an [[amplifier]], the more common term is [[gain]].  

''Deprecated synonym'' '''[[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]].'''  A system's sensitivity is the inverse of the stimulus level required to produce a threshold response, with the threshold typically chosen just above the noise level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8382">{{other uses|Reactance (disambiguation)}}

In electrical and electronic systems, '''reactance''' is the opposition of a circuit element to a change of [[electric current]] or [[voltage]], due to that element's [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. A built-up [[electric field]] resists the change of voltage on the element, while a [[magnetic field]] resists the change of current. The notion of reactance is similar to [[electrical resistance]], but they differ in several respects.

An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, while ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s consist entirely of reactance. The magnitude of the reactance of an inductor is proportional to frequency, while the  magnitude of the reactance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to frequency.

== Analysis ==

In [[phasor]] analysis, reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through the circuit element.  It is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

Both reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{R}&lt;/math&gt; are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + jX\,&lt;/math&gt;

:where
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in ohms.
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms.
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the reactance, measured in ohms.
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j \;=\; \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Both capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; and inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; contribute to the total reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;{X = X_L - X_C = \omega L -\frac {1} {\omega C}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Capacitance|capacitive]] reactance, measured in ohms
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Inductance|inductive]] reactance, measured in ohms

Although &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; are both positive by convention, the capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; makes a negative contribution to total reactance.

Hence,

* If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X \;&gt;\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the reactance is said to be [[Inductance|inductive]].
* If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the impedance is purely [[Electrical resistance|resistive]].
* If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X \;&lt;\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the reactance is said to be [[Capacitance|capacitive]]

== Capacitive reactance ==
{{main|Capacitance}}

'''Capacitive reactance''' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_C}&lt;/math&gt; is [[inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; (or [[angular frequency]] ω) and the [[capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{C}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, D. (2002). ''Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis'', page 274. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac {1} {\omega C} = \frac {1} {2\pi f C}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A capacitor consists of two [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].

At low frequencies a capacitor is [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]], as no [[Electric current|current]] flows in the dielectric.  A [[Direct current|DC]] voltage applied across a capacitor causes positive [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on one side and negative [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on the other side; the [[electric field]] due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.

Driven by an AC supply, a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge dissipates.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.

== Inductive reactance ==
{{main|Inductance}}

'''Inductive reactance''' is an opposition to the change of current through an element. Inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L&lt;/math&gt;

The average current flowing in an [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt; in series with a sinusoidal AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{A}&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;I_L = {A \over \omega L} = {A \over 2\pi f L}.&lt;/math&gt;

The average current flowing in an [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt; in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{A}&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;I_L = {A \pi^2 \over 8 \omega L} = {A\pi \over 16 f L}&lt;/math&gt; making it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was &lt;math&gt;X_L = {16 \over \pi} f L&lt;/math&gt;

Any conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-[[Electromotive force|emf]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt; (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{B}&lt;/math&gt; through a current loop.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

For an inductor consisting of a coil with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle N&lt;/math&gt; loops this gives.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -N{d\Phi_B \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The counter-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.

== Phase relationship ==

The phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (a capacitor with an infinite resistance or an inductor with a resistance of zero) ''lags'' the current by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; radians for a capacitive reactance and ''leads'' the current by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an inductive reactance.  Note that without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.

The origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor in the impedance.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \tilde{Z}_C &amp;= {1 \over \omega C}e^{j(-{\pi \over 2})} = -j\left({ \frac{1}{\omega C}}\right) = -jX_C \\
  \tilde{Z}_L &amp;= \omega Le^{j{\pi \over 2}} = j\omega L = jX_L\quad
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11998">In [[electronics]], when describing a [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] [[step function]], '''rise time''' is the time taken by a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. Typically, in [[analog electronics]], these values are 10% and 90% of the step height: in control theory applications, according to {{harvtxt|Levine|1996|p=158}}, rise time is defined as &quot;the time required for the response to rise from x% to y% of its final value&quot;, with 0%-100% rise time common for underdamped second order systems, 5%-95% for critically damped and 10%-90% for overdamped.&lt;ref name=&quot;risedef&quot;&gt;Precisely, {{harvtxt|Levine|1996|p=158}} states: &quot;The rise time is the time required for the response to rise from x% to y% of its final value. For [[Damping ratio|overdamped]] [[Control system|second order system]]s, the 0% to 100% rise time is normally used, and for [[damping ratio|underdamped systems]]... the 10% to 90% rise time is commonly used&quot;. See also the textbook {{harvnb|Nise|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The output signal of a [[system]] is characterized also by [[fall time]]: both parameters depend on rise and fall times of input signal and on the characteristics of the [[system]].

== Overview ==

Rise time is an analog parameter of fundamental importance in [[electronics|high speed electronics]], since it is a measure of the ability of a circuit to respond to fast input signals. Many efforts over the years have been made to reduce the rise times of generators, analog and digital circuits, measuring and data transmission equipment, focused on the research of faster [[electronic device|electron devices]] and on techniques of reduction of stray circuit parameters (mainly capacitances and inductances). For applications outside the realm of high speed [[electronics]], long (compared to the attainable state of the art) rise times are sometimes desirable: examples are the [[Dimmer|dimming]] of a light, where a longer rise-time results, amongst other things, in a longer life for the bulb, or digital signals apt to the control of analog ones, where a longer rise time means lower capacitive feedthrough, and thus lower coupling [[noise]].

== Simple examples of calculation of rise time ==

The aim of this section is the calculation of rise time of [[step response]] for some simple systems: all notations and assumptions required for the following analysis are listed here.

*&lt;math&gt;t_r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the rise time of the analyzed system, measured in [[second]]s.

*&lt;math&gt;f_L\,&lt;/math&gt; is the low frequency cutoff (-3 dB point) of the analyzed system, measured in [[hertz]].

*&lt;math&gt;f_H\,&lt;/math&gt; is high frequency cutoff (-3 dB point) of the analyzed system, measured in hertz.

*&lt;math&gt;h(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[impulse response]] of the analyzed system in the time domain.

*&lt;math&gt;H(\omega)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency response]] of the analyzed system in the frequency domain.

*The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;BW = f_{H} - f_{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:and since the low frequency cutoff &lt;math&gt;f_L&lt;/math&gt; is usually several decades lower than the high frequency cutoff &lt;math&gt;f_H&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;BW\cong f_H\,&lt;/math&gt;

*All systems analyzed here have a [[frequency response]] which extends to 0 (low-pass systems), thus 
:&lt;math&gt;f_L=0\,\Leftrightarrow\,f_H=BW&lt;/math&gt; exactly. 
*All systems analyzed are thought as [[electrical network]]s and all the signals are thought as [[voltage]]s for the sake of simplicity: the input is a [[step function]] of &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; [[volt]]s.

=== Gaussian response system ===

A system is said to have a [[Gaussian]] response if it is characterized by the following frequency response

:&lt;math&gt;|H(\omega)|=e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{\sigma^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, related to the high frequency cutoff by the following relation: 

:&lt;math&gt;f_H = \frac{\sigma}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{3}{20\log e}} \cong 0.0935 \sigma&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding [[impulse response]] can be calculated using the inverse [[Fourier transform]] of the shown [[frequency response]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{H\}(t)=h(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} {e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{\sigma^2}}e^{i\omega t}} d\omega=\frac{\sigma}{2\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{4}\sigma^2t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying directly the definition of [[step response]]

:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = V_0{H*h}(t) = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\frac{\sigma t}{2}}e^{-\tau^2}d\tau = \frac{V_0}{2}\left[1+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sigma t}{2}\right)\right]\Leftrightarrow\frac{V(t)}{V_0}=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sigma t}{2}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for time the two following equations by using known properties of the [[error function]]

:&lt;math&gt;0.1=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sigma t_1}{2}\right)\right]
\qquad0.9=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sigma t_2}{2}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

the value &lt;math&gt;t=-t_1=t_2&lt;/math&gt; is then known and since &lt;math&gt;t_r=t_2-t_1=2t&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_r=\frac{4}{\sigma}{\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.8)}\cong\frac{0.3394}{f_H}&lt;/math&gt;

and then

:&lt;math&gt;t_r\cong\frac{0.34}{BW}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad BW\cdot t_r\cong 0.34&lt;/math&gt;

===One stage low pass RC network===

For a simple one stage low pass [[RC circuit|RC network]], also known as a single-pole filter, the 10% to 90% rise time is proportional to the network time constant &lt;math&gt;\tau=RC&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;t_r\cong 2.197\tau\,&lt;/math&gt;

The proportionality constant can be derived by using the output response of the network to a [[unit step function]] input signal of &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; amplitude, also known as its [[step response]]:

:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = V_0 \left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for time

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V(t)}{V_0}=\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V(t)}{V_0}-1=-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1-\frac{V(t)}{V_0}=e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\left(1-\frac{V(t)}{V_0}\right)=-\frac{t}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; t = -\tau \; \ln\left(1-\frac{V(t)}{V_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We call t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the time needed to go from 0% to 10% of the steady-state value, and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the one to 90%.
Thus t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{V(t)}{V_0}=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{V(t)}{V_0}=0.9&lt;/math&gt;.
Solving the previous equation for these two values we find the analytical expression for t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; t_1 = -\tau\;\ln\left(1-0.1\right) = -\tau \; \ln\left(0.9\right) = -\tau\;\ln\left(\frac{9}{10}\right) = \tau\;\ln\left(\frac{10}{9}\right) = \tau({\ln 10}-{\ln 9})&lt;/math&gt;

We obtain t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the same way, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt;t_2=\tau\ln{10}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the rise time, which is therefore proportional to the time constant:

:&lt;math&gt;t_r = t_2-t_1 = \tau\cdot\ln 9\cong\tau\cdot 2.197&lt;/math&gt;

Now, noting that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = RC = \frac{1}{2\pi f_H}&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[Time_constant#Relation of time constant to bandwidth|here]] for the proof of the previous equation) then

:&lt;math&gt;t_r\cong\frac{2.197}{2\pi f_H}\cong\frac{0.349}{f_H}&lt;/math&gt;

and since the high frequency cutoff is equal to the [[bandwidth (signal processing)]]

:&lt;math&gt;t_r\cong\frac{0.35}{BW}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad BW\cdot t_r\cong 0.35&lt;/math&gt;


Note that, if the rise time is 20% to 80% instead of 10% to 90%, &lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt; becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;t_r\cong 1.386\tau\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad t_r\cong\frac{0.22}{BW}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Rise time of cascaded blocks ===

Consider a system composed by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cascaded non interacting blocks, each having a rise time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{t_{r_i}}&lt;/math&gt; and no [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] in their [[step response]]: suppose also that the input signal of the first block has a rise time whose value is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{t_{r_S}}&lt;/math&gt;. Then its output signal has a rise time &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{t_{r_O}}&lt;/math&gt; equal to

:&lt;math&gt;t_{r_O}=\sqrt{t_{r_S}^2+t_{r_1}^2+\dots+t_{r_n}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This result is a consequence of the [[central limit theorem]], as reported in {{Harvnb|Valley|Wallman|1948|pp=77–78}} and proved by [[Henry Wallman]] in {{Harvnb|Wallman|1950}}.&lt;ref&gt;This beautiful one-page paper does not contain any calculation. [[Henry Wallman]] simply sets up a table he calls [[dictionary]] paralleling concepts from [[electronics engineering]] and [[probability theory]]: the key of the process is the use of [[Laplace transform]]. Then he notes that, following the correspondence of concepts established by the [[dictionary]], that the [[step response]] of a cascade of blocks corresponds to the [[central limit theorem]] and states that: &quot;This has important practical consequences, among them the fact that if a network is free of overshoot its time-of-response inevitably increases rapidly upon cascading, namely as the square-root of the number of cascaded network&quot;.{{harv|Wallman|1950|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors affecting rise time ==

Rise time values in a resistive circuit are primarily due to stray [[capacitance]] and [[inductance]] in the circuit. Because every [[electrical network|circuit]] has not only [[electrical resistance|resistance]], but also [[capacitance]] and [[inductance]], a delay in voltage and/or current at the load is apparent until the [[Steady state theory|steady state]] is reached. In a pure [[RC circuit]], the output risetime (10% to 90%), as shown above, is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;2.2 RC&lt;/math&gt;.

== Rise time in control applications ==
In control theory, for overdamped systems, rise time is commonly defined as the time for a waveform to go from 10% to 90% of its final value.&lt;ref name=&quot;risedef&quot;/&gt;

The [[quadratic function|quadratic]] [[approximation]] for normalized rise time for a 2nd-order system, [[step response]], no zeros is:
:&lt;math&gt; t_r \cdot\omega_0= 2.230\zeta^2-0.078\zeta+1.12\,&lt;/math&gt;  
where ζ is the [[damping ratio]] and ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[natural frequency]] of the network.  

However, the proper calculation for rise time from 0 to 100% of an under-damped 2nd-order system is:
:&lt;math&gt; t_r \cdot\omega_0= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}\left ( \pi - \tan^{-1}\left ( {\frac{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{\zeta}} \right )\right )&lt;/math&gt;
where ζ is the damping ratio and ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the natural frequency of the network.

[[File:Complex Impedance.svg|200px|thumb|right|A graphical representation of the [[Complex plane|complex impedance plane]]]]
'''Electrical impedance''' is the measure of the opposition that a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] presents to a [[electrical current|current]] when a [[voltage]] is applied. 

In quantitative terms, it is the [[complex number|complex]] [[ratio]] of the voltage to the current in an [[alternating current]] (AC) circuit. Impedance extends the concept of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to AC circuits, and possesses both magnitude and [[Phase (waves)|phase]], unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. When a circuit is driven with [[direct current]] (DC), there is no distinction between impedance and resistance; the latter can be thought of as impedance with zero [[phase angle]].

It is necessary to introduce the concept of impedance in AC circuits because there are two additional impeding mechanisms to be taken into account besides the normal resistance of DC circuits: the induction of voltages in conductors self-induced by the magnetic fields of currents ([[inductance]]), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between conductors ([[capacitance]]).  The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and forms the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part of complex impedance whereas resistance forms the [[real number|real]] part.

The symbol for impedance is usually {{math|''Z''}} and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the form {{math|{{!}}''Z''{{!}}''∠θ''}}.  However, complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes. The term ''impedance'' was coined by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in July 1886.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', p.&amp;nbsp;18, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Heaviside, ''The Electrician'', p.&amp;nbsp;212, 23 July 1886, reprinted as ''Electrical Papers'', p 64, AMS Bookstore, ISBN 0-8218-3465-7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur Kennelly]] was the first to represent impedance with complex numbers in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4768008 Kennelly, Arthur. ''Impedance'' (AIEE, 1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Impedance is defined as the [[frequency domain]] ratio of the voltage to the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Alexander  | first = Charles  | last2 = Sadiku  | first2 = Matthew  | title = Fundamentals of Electric Circuits  | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | year = 2006  | edition = 3, revised  | pages =387–389  | isbn = 978-0-07-330115-0  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is the voltage–current ratio for a single [[complex exponential]] at a particular frequency {{math|''ω''}}. In general, impedance will be a complex number, with the same [[dimensional analysis|units]] as resistance, for which the [[SI unit]] is the [[ohm]] ({{math|Ω}}). For a sinusoidal current or voltage input, the [[Complex number#Notation_of_the_polar_form|polar form]] of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In particular,
* The magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude.
* The phase of the complex impedance is the [[phase shift]] by which the current lags the voltage.
The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of impedance is [[admittance]] (i.e., admittance is the current-to-voltage ratio, and it conventionally carries units of [[siemens (unit)|siemens]], formerly called [[mho]]s).

==Complex impedance==
Impedance is represented as a [[Complex number|complex]] quantity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; and the term ''complex impedance'' may be used interchangeably; the [[Polar coordinates|polar form]] conveniently captures both magnitude and phase characteristics,

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j\arg (Z)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the magnitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, while the argument &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \arg (Z)&lt;/math&gt; (commonly given the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta &lt;/math&gt;) gives the phase difference between voltage and current. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], and is used instead of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle i&lt;/math&gt; in this context to avoid confusion with the symbol for [[Ampere|electric current]].  In [[Cartesian plane|Cartesian form]],

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[real part]] of impedance is the resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; and the [[imaginary part]] is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;.

Where it is required to add or subtract impedances the cartesian form is more convenient, but when quantities are multiplied or divided the calculation becomes simpler if the polar form is used.  A circuit calculation, such as finding the total impedance of two impedances in parallel, may require conversion between forms several times during the calculation.  Conversion between the forms follows the normal [[Complex number#Polar form|conversion rules of complex numbers]].

== Ohm's law ==
[[File:General AC circuit.svg|thumb|right|169px|An AC supply applying a voltage &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt;, across a [[Electrical load|load]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt;, driving a current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;.]]
{{Main|Ohm's law}}

The meaning of electrical impedance can be understood by substituting it into [[Ohm's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html AC Ohm's law], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH1&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul|coauthors=Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |pages=32–33 |chapter=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ V = I Z = I |Z| e^{j \arg (Z)}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; acts just like resistance, giving the drop in voltage amplitude across an impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; for a given current &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;.  The phase factor tells us that the current lags the voltage by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta \;=\; \arg (Z)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., in the [[time domain]], the current signal is shifted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} T&lt;/math&gt; later with respect to the voltage signal).

Just as impedance extends Ohm's law to cover AC circuits, other results from DC circuit analysis such as [[Voltage divider|voltage division]], [[Current divider|current division]], [[Thévenin's theorem]], and [[Norton's theorem]] can also be extended to AC circuits by replacing resistance with impedance.

== Complex voltage and current ==
[[File:Impedance symbol comparison.svg|thumb|right|200px|Generalized impedances in a circuit can be drawn with the same symbol as a resistor (US ANSI or DIN Euro) or with a labeled box.]]
In order to simplify calculations, [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al voltage and current waves are commonly represented as complex-valued functions of time denoted as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/impcom.html#c1 Complex impedance], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HH2&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul|coauthors= Hill, Winfield |title=The Art of Electronics |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |pages=31–32 |chapter=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V &amp;= |V|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)} \\
  I &amp;= |I|e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Impedance is defined as the ratio of these quantities.

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these into Ohm's law we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  |V| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_V)} &amp;= |I| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I)} |Z| e^{j\theta}    \\
                               &amp;= |I| |Z| e^{j(\omega t + \phi_I + \theta)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that this must hold for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, we may equate the magnitudes and phases to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     |V| &amp;= |I| |Z| \\
  \phi_V &amp;= \phi_I + \theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude equation is the familiar Ohm's law applied to the voltage and current amplitudes, while the second equation defines the phase relationship.

=== Validity of complex representation ===
This representation using complex exponentials may be justified by noting that (by [[Euler's formula]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big[ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} + e^{-j(\omega t + \phi)}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;

The real-valued sinusoidal function representing either voltage or current may be broken into two complex-valued functions.  By the principle of [[superposition principle|superposition]], we may analyse the behaviour of the sinusoid on the left-hand side by analysing the behaviour of the two complex terms on the right-hand side.  Given the symmetry, we only need to perform the analysis for one right-hand term; the results will be identical for the other.  At the end of any calculation, we may return to real-valued sinusoids by further noting that

:&lt;math&gt;\ \cos(\omega t + \phi) = \Re \Big\{ e^{j(\omega t + \phi)} \Big\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Phasors ===
{{Main|Phasor (electronics)}}

A phasor is a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a sinusoidal function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids, where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.

The impedance of a circuit element can be defined as the ratio of the phasor voltage across the element to the phasor current through the element, as determined by the relative amplitudes and phases of the voltage and current.  This is identical to the definition from [[Electrical impedance#Ohm's law|Ohm's law]] given above, recognising that the factors of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e^{j\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; cancel.

== Device examples ==
[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|250px|The phase angles in the equations for the impedance of inductors and capacitors indicate that the voltage across a capacitor ''lags'' the current through it by a phase of &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, while the voltage across an inductor ''leads'' the current through it by &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;. The identical voltage and current amplitudes indicate that the magnitude of the impedance is equal to one.]]

The impedance of an ideal [[resistor]] is purely real and is referred to as a ''resistive impedance'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_R = R&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the voltage and current waveforms are proportional and in phase.

Ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have a purely [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] ''reactive impedance'':

the impedance of inductors increases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_L = j\omega L&lt;/math&gt;

the impedance of capacitors decreases as frequency increases;

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases, for an applied sinusoidal voltage, the resulting current is also sinusoidal, but in quadrature, 90 degrees out of phase with the voltage. However, the phases have opposite signs: in an inductor, the current is ''lagging''; in a capacitor the current is ''leading''.

Note the following identities for the imaginary unit and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                      j &amp;\equiv \cos{\left( \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} + j\sin{\left( \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \equiv e^{j  \frac{\pi}{2}} \\
  \frac{1}{j} \equiv -j &amp;\equiv \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} + j\sin{\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \equiv e^{j(-\frac{\pi}{2})}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the inductor and capacitor impedance equations can be rewritten in polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Z_L &amp;= \omega Le^{j\frac{\pi}{2}} \\
  Z_C &amp;= \frac{1}{\omega C}e^{j\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude gives the change in voltage amplitude for a given current amplitude through the impedance, while the exponential factors give the phase relationship.

=== Deriving the device-specific impedances ===
What follows below is a derivation of impedance for each of the three basic [[Electrical network|circuit]] elements: the resistor, the capacitor, and the inductor.  Although the idea can be extended to define the relationship between the voltage and current of any arbitrary [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]], these derivations will assume [[sinusoidal]] signals, since any arbitrary signal can be approximated as a sum of sinusoids through [[Fourier analysis]].

====Resistor====
For a resistor, there is the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{R}} \left( t \right) = {i_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)}R&lt;/math&gt;

This is [[Ohm's law]].

Considering the voltage signal to be
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{R}}(t) = V_p \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{R}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{V_p \sin(\omega t)}{I_p \sin \left( \omega  t \right)} = R&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to [[alternating current]] (AC) amplitude across a resistor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage leads the current across a resistor by 0 degrees.

This result is commonly expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{resistor}} = R&lt;/math&gt;

====Capacitor====
For a capacitor, there is the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\text{C}}(t) = C \frac{\operatorname{d}v_{\text{C}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the voltage signal to be
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{C}}(t) = V_p \sin(\omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}v_{\text{C}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t} = \omega  V_p \cos \left( \omega  t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

And thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{C}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{C}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{V_p \sin(\omega t)}{\omega V_p C \cos \left( \omega  t \right)}= \frac{\sin(\omega t)}{\omega C \sin \left( \omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to AC current  amplitude across a capacitor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage lags the AC current across a capacitor by 90 degrees (or the AC current leads the AC voltage across a capacitor by 90 degrees).

This result is commonly expressed in [[polar form]], as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{capacitor}} = \frac{1}{\omega C} e^{-j \frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, by applying Euler's formula, as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{capacitor}} = -j\frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{j \omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

====Inductor====
For the inductor, we have the relation:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{L}}(t) = L \frac{\operatorname{d}i_{\text{L}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

This time, considering the current signal to be
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\text{L}}(t) = I_p \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}i_{\text{L}}(t)}{\operatorname{d}t} = \omega I_p \cos \left( \omega  t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

And thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{L}} \left( t \right)}{i_{\text{L}} \left( t \right)} = \frac{\omega I_p L \cos(\omega t)}{I_p \sin \left( \omega  t \right)} = \frac{\omega L \sin \left( \omega  t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{\sin(\omega t)}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the ratio of AC voltage amplitude to AC current amplitude across an inductor is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega L&lt;/math&gt;, and that the AC voltage leads the AC current across an inductor by 90 degrees.

This result is commonly expressed in polar form, as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{inductor}} = \omega L e^{j \frac{\pi}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, using Euler's formula, as
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{inductor}} = j \omega L&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalised s-plane impedance==
Impedance defined in terms of ''jω'' can strictly only be applied to circuits which are driven with a steady-state AC signal.  The concept of impedance can be extended to a circuit energised with any arbitrary signal by using [[complex frequency]] instead of ''jω''.  Complex frequency is given the symbol ''s'' and is, in general, a complex number.  Signals are expressed in terms of complex frequency by taking the [[Laplace transform]] of the [[time domain]] expression of the signal.  The impedance of the basic circuit elements in this more general notation is as follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:3em;&quot;
|-
!Element||Impedance expression
|-
|Resistor||&lt;math&gt;R \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Inductor||&lt;math&gt;sL \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Capacitor||&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{sC} \,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For a DC circuit this simplifies to {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 0}}.  For a steady-state sinusoidal AC signal {{nowrap|1=''s'' = ''jω''}}.

== Resistance vs reactance ==

Resistance and reactance together determine the magnitude and phase of the impedance through the following relations:

:&lt;math&gt;|Z| = \sqrt{Z Z^*} = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{X}{R}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In many applications the relative phase of the voltage and current is not critical so only the magnitude of the impedance is significant.

=== Resistance ===
&lt;!--[[File:Resistors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pack of resistors. [[Media:Resistors.jpg|Actual size]]]]--&gt;
{{Main|Electrical resistance}}

Resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of impedance; a device with a purely resistive impedance exhibits no phase shift between the voltage and current.

:&lt;math&gt;\ R = |Z| \cos{\theta} \quad&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reactance ===
{{Main|Electrical reactance}}

Reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the impedance; a component with a finite reactance induces a phase shift &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; between the voltage across it and the current through it.

:&lt;math&gt;\ X = |Z| \sin{\theta}  \quad&lt;/math&gt;

A purely reactive component is distinguished by the sinusoidal voltage across the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This implies that the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance will not dissipate any power.

==== Capacitive reactance ====
&lt;!--[[File:Photo-SMDcapacitors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Capacitors: [[Surface-mount technology|SMD]] ceramic at top left; SMD tantalum at bottom left; [[through-hole]] tantalum at top right; through-hole electrolytic at bottom right. Major scale divisions are cm. [[Media:Resistors.jpg|Actual size]]]]--&gt;
{{Main|Capacitance}}

A capacitor has a purely reactive impedance which is [[Inversely proportional#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]].  A capacitor consists of two [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].

:&lt;math&gt;X_C = (\omega C)^{-1} = (2\pi f C)^{-1}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

At low frequencies a capacitor is open circuit, as no charge flows in the dielectric. A DC voltage applied across a capacitor causes [[Electrical charge|charge]] to accumulate on one side; the [[electric field]] due to the accumulated charge is the source of the opposition to the current. When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.

Driven by an AC supply, a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes sign and the charge dissipates.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.

==== Inductive reactance ====
{{Main|Inductance}}

Inductive reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X_L}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{f}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L\quad&lt;/math&gt;

An inductor consists of a coiled conductor.  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the back [[Electromotive force|emf]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathcal{E}}&lt;/math&gt; (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{B}&lt;/math&gt; through a current loop.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -{{d\Phi_B} \over dt}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

For an inductor consisting of a coil with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; loops this gives.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = -N{d\Phi_B \over dt}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

The back-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.

==== Total reactance ====

The total reactance is given by

:&lt;math&gt;{X = X_L - X_C}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the total impedance is

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

== Combining impedances ==
{{Main|Series and parallel circuits}}

The total impedance of many simple networks of components can be calculated using the rules for combining impedances in series and parallel.  The rules are identical to those used for combining resistances, except that the numbers in general will be complex numbers.  In the general case however, [[equivalent impedance transforms]] in addition to series and parallel will be required.

=== Series combination ===

For components connected in series, the current through each circuit element is the same; the total impedance is the sum of the component impedances.

[[File:Impedances in series.svg]]

:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = Z_1 + Z_2 + \cdots + Z_n \quad&lt;/math&gt;

Or explicitly in real and imaginary terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = R + jX = (R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n) + j(X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n) \quad&lt;/math&gt;

=== Parallel combination ===

For components connected in parallel, the voltage across each circuit element is the same; the ratio of currents through any two elements is the inverse ratio of their impedances.

:[[File:Impedances in parallel.svg]]

Hence the inverse total impedance is the sum of the inverses of the component impedances:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{Z_n}&lt;/math&gt;

or, when n = 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} = \frac{Z_1 + Z_2}{Z_1 Z_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ Z_{\text{eq}} = \frac{Z_1 Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated in terms of the equivalent series resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt; and reactance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_{\text{eq}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html#c3 Parallel Impedance Expressions], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  Z_{\text{eq}} &amp;= R_{\text{eq}} + j X_{\text{eq}} \\
  R_{\text{eq}} &amp;= \frac{(X_1 R_2 + X_2 R_1) (X_1 + X_2) + (R_1 R_2 - X_1 X_2) (R_1 + R_2)}{(R_1 + R_2)^2 + (X_1 + X_2)^2} \\
  X_{\text{eq}} &amp;= \frac{(X_1 R_2 + X_2 R_1) (R_1 + R_2) - (R_1 R_2 - X_1 X_2) (X_1 + X_2)}{(R_1 + R_2)^2 + (X_1 + X_2)^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Measurement ==
The measurement of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in [[radio]] technology and others. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example in a [[radio antenna]] the [[standing wave ratio]] or [[reflection coefficient]] may be more useful than the impedance alone. Measurement of impedance requires measurement of the magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [[Bridge circuit |&quot;bridge&quot; methods]], similar to the direct-current [[Wheatstone bridge]]; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. Impedance measurement in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device. 

The impedance of a device can be calculated by complex division of the voltage and current. The impedance of the device can be calculated by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with a resistor, and measuring the voltage across the resistor and across the device. Performing this measurement by sweeping the frequencies of the applied signal provides the impedance phase and magnitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisJr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis Jr. |first=George |authorlink= |coauthors=George K. Lewis Sr. and William Olbricht |date=August 2008 |title=Cost-effective broad-band electrical impedance spectroscopy measurement circuit and signal analysis for piezo-materials and ultrasound transducers |journal=Measurement Science and Technology |volume=19 |issue= 10|pages=105102 |id= |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0957-0233/19/10/105102/ |accessdate=2008-09-15 |quote= |doi=10.1088/0957-0233/19/10/105102 |pmid=19081773 |pmc=2600501 |bibcode = 2008MeScT..19j5102L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of an impulse response may be used in combination with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) to rapidly measure the electrical impedance of various electrical devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisJr&quot;/&gt;

The [[LCR meter]] (Inductance (L), Capacitance (C), and Resistance (R)) is a device commonly used to measure the inductance, resistance and capacitance of a component; from these values the impedance at any frequency can be calculated.

== Variable impedance ==
In general, neither impedance nor admittance can be time varying as they are defined for complex exponentials for –∞ &lt; ''t'' &lt; +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the circuit element cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., [[varicap]]s that are used in [[Tuner (radio)|radio tuners]]) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI)]] for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance.  That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12592">'''Electrical elements''' are conceptual abstractions representing [[idealized]] [[electrical component]]s, such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s, used in the [[circuit analysis|analysis]] of [[electrical network]]s. Any electrical network can be analysed as multiple, interconnected electrical elements in a [[Schematic diagram#Electronic industry|schematic diagram]] or [[circuit diagram]], each of which affects the [[voltage]] in the network or [[Current (electricity)|current]] through the network. These ideal electrical elements represent real, physical [[Electronic component|electrical or electronic components]] but they do not exist physically and they are assumed to have ideal properties according to a [[lumped element model]], while components are objects with less than ideal properties, a degree of uncertainty in their values and some degree of nonlinearity, each of which may require a combination of multiple electrical elements in order to approximate its function.

Circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding many practical electrical networks using components. By analyzing the way a network is affected by its individual elements it is possible to estimate how a real network will behave.

==One-port elements==
Only nine types of element ([[memristor]] not included), five passive and four active, are required to model any electrical component or circuit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Each element is defined by a relation between the [[state variable]]s of the network: [[Current (electricity)|current]], &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;; [[voltage]], &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, [[Electric charge|charge]], &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; and [[magnetic flux]], &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. 

* Two sources:
**[[Current source]], measured in [[ampere]]s – produces a current in a conductor.  Affects charge according to the relation &lt;math&gt;dQ = -I\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
**[[Voltage source]], measured in [[volt]]s – produces a [[potential difference]] between two points.  Affects magnetic flux according to the relation &lt;math&gt;d\Phi = V\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; in this relationship does not necessarily represent anything physically meaningful.  In the case of the current generator, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, the time integral of current, represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator.  Here &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the time integral of voltage but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source.  For a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful, but for an electrochemical source, or a voltage that is the output of another circuit, no physical meaning is attached to it.
::Both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements.  See [[#Non-linear elements]] below.

* Three [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] elements:
**[[Electrical resistance|Resistance]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]] – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element.  Relates voltage and current according to the relation &lt;math&gt;dV = R\,dI&lt;/math&gt;.
**[[Capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, measured in [[farad]]s – produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element.  Relates charge and voltage according to the relation &lt;math&gt;dQ = C\,dV&lt;/math&gt;.
**[[Inductance]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, measured in [[Henry (unit)|henries]] – produces the magnetic flux proportional to the rate of change of current through the element.  Relates flux and current according to the relation &lt;math&gt;d\Phi = L\,dI&lt;/math&gt;.

* Four abstract active elements:
** Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) Generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain. (has infinite input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and zero output impedance).
** Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) Generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit, with respect to a specified gain, used to model [[field-effect transistor]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s (has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance).  The gain is characterised by a [[transfer conductance]] which will have units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]].
** Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS) Generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain. (has zero input impedance and zero output impedance).  The gain is characterised by a [[transfer impedance]] which will have units of [[ohm]]s.
** Current-controlled current source (CCCS) Generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain. Used to model [[bipolar junction transistor]]s. (Has zero input impedance and infinite output impedance).
::These four elements are examples of [[#Two-port elements|two-port elements]].

===Non-linear elements===
In reality, all circuit components are non-linear and can only be approximated to linear over a certain range.  To more exactly describe the passive elements, their [[constitutive relation]] is used instead of simple proportionality.  From any two of the circuit variables there are six constitutive relations that can be formed.  From this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total (not including the various dependent sources) found in linear network analysis.  This additional element is called [[memristor]].  It only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element; as a time-independent linear element it reduces to a regular resistor.  The constitutive relations of the passive elements are given by;&lt;ref name=Trajkovic&gt;Ljiljana Trajković, &quot;Nonlinear circuits&quot;, ''The Electrical Engineering Handbook'' (Ed: Wai-Kai Chen), pp.75–77, Academic Press, 2005 ISBN 0-12-170960-4&lt;/ref&gt;

*Resistance: constitutive relation defined as &lt;math&gt;f(V, I)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
*Capacitance: constitutive relation defined as &lt;math&gt;f(V, Q)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
*Inductance: constitutive relation defined as &lt;math&gt;f(\Phi, I)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
*Memristance: constitutive relation defined as &lt;math&gt;f(\Phi, Q)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

:where &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary function of two variables.

In some special cases the constitutive relation simplifies to a function of one variable.  This is the case for all linear elements, but also for example, an ideal [[diode]], which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor, has a constitutive relation of the form &lt;math&gt; V = f(I)&lt;/math&gt;.  Both independent voltage, and independent current sources can be considered non-linear resistors under this definition.&lt;ref name=Trajkovic/&gt;

The fourth passive element, the memristor, was proposed by [[Leon Chua]] in a 1971 paper, but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later. It was reported on April 30, 2008, that a working memristor had been developed by a team at [[HP Labs]] led by scientist [[R. Stanley Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Strukov|first=Dmitri B|last2=Snider|first2=Gregory S|last3=Stewart|first3=Duncan R|last4=Williams|first4=Stanley R|title=The missing memristor found|journal=Nature|volume=453|pages=80–83|year=2008|doi=10.1038/nature06932|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/full/nature06932.html|pmid=18451858|issue=7191|bibcode=2008Natur.453...80S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EETimes, 30 April 2008, [http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521 'Missing link' memristor created], EETimes, 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn13812-engineers-find-missing-link-of-electronics.html Engineers find 'missing link' of electronics] – 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news128786808.html Researchers Prove Existence of New Basic Element for Electronic Circuits – 'Memristor'] – 30 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advent of the memristor, each pairing of the four variables can now be related. Because memristors are time-variant by definition, they are not included in [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI)]] circuit models.{{cn|reason=they are not included because they are not linear surely. It is perfectly feasible to have a time invariant memristor as a theoretical ideal element|date=May 2013}}

There are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component:

*[[Nullator]]: defined as &lt;math&gt; V = I  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*[[Norator]]: defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever.

These are sometimes used in models of components with more than two terminals: transistors for instance.&lt;ref name=Trajkovic/&gt;

==Two-port elements==
All the above are two-terminal, or one-port, elements with the exception of the dependent sources.  There are two lossless, passive, linear [[two-port network|two-port]] elements that are normally introduced into network analysis.  Their constitutive relations in matrix notation are;

;Transformer:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}  V_1  \\ I_2  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; n \\ -n &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} I_1  \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

;Gyrator:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}  V_1  \\ V_2  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -r \\ r &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} I_1  \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The transformer maps a voltage at one port to a voltage at the other in a ratio of ''n''.  The current between the same two port is mapped by 1/''n''.  The [[gyrator]], on the other hand, maps a voltage at one port to a current at the other.  Likewise, currents are mapped to voltages.  The quantity ''r'' in the matrix is in units of resistance.  The gyrator is a necessary element in analysis because it is not [[Reciprocity_(electromagnetism)#Reciprocity_for_electrical_networks|reciprocal]].  Networks built from the basic linear elements only are obliged to be reciprocal and so cannot be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system.  It is not essential, however, to have both the transformer and gyrator.  Two gyrators in cascade are equivalent to a transformer but the transformer is usually retained for convenience.  Introduction of the gyrator also makes either capacitance or inductance non-essential since a gyrator terminated with one of these at port 2 will be equivalent to the other at port 1.  However, transformer, capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components [[transformer]], [[inductor]] and [[capacitor]] whereas a [[Gyrator#Implementation: a simulated inductor|practical gyrator]] must be constructed as an active circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Wadhwa, C.L., ''Network analysis and synthesis'', pp.17–22, New Age International, ISBN 81-224-1753-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert J. Carlin, Pier Paolo Civalleri, ''Wideband circuit design'', pp.171–172, CRC Press, 1998 ISBN 0-8493-7897-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vjekoslav Damić, John Montgomery, ''Mechatronics by bond graphs: an object-oriented approach to modelling and simulation'', pp.32–33, Springer, 2003 ISBN 3-540-42375-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements.
* On a first degree of approximation, a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] is represented by a voltage source. A more refined model also includes a resistance in series with the voltage source, to represent the battery's internal resistance (which results in the battery heating and the voltage dropping when in use). A current source in parallel may be added to represent its leakage (which discharges the battery over a long period of time).
* On a first degree of approximation, a [[resistor]] is represented by a resistance. A more refined model also includes a series inductance, to represent the effects of its lead inductance (resistors constructed as a spiral have more significant inductance). A capacitance in parallel may be added to represent the capacitive effect of the proximity of the resistor leads to each other. A wire can be represented as a low-value resistor
* Current sources are more often used when representing [[semiconductor]]s. For example, on a first degree of approximation, a bipolar [[transistor]] may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47459">'''Scattering parameters''' or '''S-parameters''' (the elements of a '''scattering matrix''' or '''S-matrix''') describe the electrical behavior of [[linear]] [[electrical network]]s when undergoing various [[steady state]] stimuli by electrical signals.

The parameters are useful for [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], and [[communications system|communication systems]] design, and especially for [[microwave engineering]].

The S-parameters are members of a family of similar parameters, other examples being: [[Y-parameters]],&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005); ''Microwave Engineering, Third Edition'' (Intl. Ed.); John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.; pp. 170-174. ISBN 0-471-44878-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Z-parameters]],&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit.); pp. 170-174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Two port#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)|H-parameters]], [[#Scattering transfer parameters|T-parameters]] or [[ABCD-parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit.); pp. 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A. H. (1985); '' Advanced Electrical Engineering''; Pitman Publishing Ltd.; pp. 33-72.  ISBN 0-273-40172-6.&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from these, in the sense that ''S-parameters'' do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, [[impedance matching|matched load]]s are used. These [[electrical termination|termination]]s are much easier to use at high signal frequencies than open-circuit and short-circuit terminations. Moreover, the quantities are measured in terms of power.

Many electrical properties of networks of components ([[inductors]], [[capacitors]], [[resistors]]) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as [[gain]], [[return loss]], [[voltage standing wave ratio]] (VSWR), [[reflection coefficient]] and [[amplifier]] stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to [[optical engineering]] than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a [[plane wave|plane electromagnetic wave]] is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar [[dielectric]] media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers to the way in which the traveling [[Electric current|currents]] and [[volt]]ages in a [[transmission line]] are affected when they meet a [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] differing from the line's [[characteristic impedance]].

Although applicable at any [[frequency]], S-parameters are mostly used for networks operating at [[radio frequency]] (RF) and [[microwave]] frequencies where signal power and energy considerations are more easily quantified than currents and voltages. S-parameters change with the measurement frequency, so frequency must be specified for any S-parameter measurements stated, in addition to the [[characteristic impedance]] or [[nominal impedance|system impedance]].

S-parameters are readily represented in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form and obey the rules of matrix algebra.

==Background==
The first published description of S-parameters was in the thesis of [[Vitold Belevitch]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Belevitch, Vitold [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4066784 &quot;Summary of the history of circuit theory&quot;], ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol.50''', iss.5, pp.&amp;nbsp;848–855, May 1962.&lt;br&gt;Vandewalle, Joos [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-007X%28200009/10%2928:5%3C429::AID-CTA121%3E3.0.CO;2-6/abstract &quot;In memoriam – Vitold Belevitch&quot;], ''International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications'', '''vol.28''', iss.5, pp.&amp;nbsp;429–430, September/October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name used by Belevitch was ''repartition matrix'' and limited consideration to lumped-element networks.  The term ''scattering matrix'' was used by physicist and engineer [[Robert Henry Dicke]] in 1947 who independently developed the idea during wartime work on radar.&lt;ref&gt;Valkenburg, Mac Elwyn Van ''Circuit Theory: Foundations and Classical Contributions'', p.334, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania: Dowden, Hutchinson &amp; Ross, 1974 ISBN 0-87933-084-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1697561 J. Appl. Phys. 18, 873 (1947); doi: 10.1063/1.1697561 A Computational Method Applicable to Microwave Networks R. H. Dicke]&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was popularized in the 1960s by Kaneyuka Kurokawa&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the S-parameter approach, an electrical network is regarded as  a '[[black box]]' containing various interconnected basic electrical circuit components or [[Lumped component|lumped elements]] such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transistors, which interacts with other circuits through ''ports''.  The network is characterized by a square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of [[complex number]]s called its S-parameter matrix, which can be used to calculate its response to signals applied to the ports.

For the S-parameter definition, it is understood that a network may contain any components provided that the entire network behaves [[linear]]ly with incident small signals. It may also include many typical communication system components or 'blocks' such as [[amplifier]]s, [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]], [[electronic filter|filters]], [[directional coupler|couplers]] and [[Equalization filter|equalizers]] provided they are also operating under linear and defined conditions.

An electrical network to be described by S-parameters may have any number of ports. Ports are the points at which electrical signals either enter or exit the network.  Ports are usually pairs of terminals with the requirement that the [[electric current|current]] into one terminal is equal to the current leaving the other.&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit.); p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A. H. (1985) (op. cit.); p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  S-parameters are used  at frequencies where the ports are often [[coaxial]] or [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] connections.

The S-parameter [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] describing an ''N''-port network will be square of dimension ''N'' and will therefore contain &lt;math&gt;N^2\,&lt;/math&gt; elements. At the test frequency each element or S-parameter is represented by a unitless [[complex number]] that represents [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[angle]], i.e. [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]]. The complex number may either be expressed in [[rectangular]] form or, more commonly, in [[Polar coordinates|polar]] form. The S-parameter magnitude may be expressed in linear form or [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic form]].  When expressed in logarithmic form, magnitude has the &quot;[[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless unit]]&quot; of [[decibel]]s. The S-parameter angle is most frequently expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] but occasionally in [[radian]]s. Any S-parameter may be displayed graphically on a polar diagram by a dot for one frequency or a [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] for a range of frequencies. If it applies to one port only (being of the form &lt;math&gt;S_{nn}\,&lt;/math&gt;), it may be displayed on an impedance or admittance [[Smith Chart]] normalised to the system impedance. The Smith Chart allows simple conversion between the &lt;math&gt;S_{nn}\,&lt;/math&gt; parameter, equivalent to the voltage reflection coefficient and the associated (normalised) impedance (or admittance) 'seen' at that port.

The following information must be defined when specifying a set of S-parameters:
#The frequency
#The characteristic impedance (often 50&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;)
#The allocation of port numbers
#Conditions which may affect the network, such as temperature, control voltage, and bias current, where applicable.

==The general S-parameter matrix==

===Definition===
For a generic multi-port network, each of the ports is allocated an integer ''n'' ranging from 1 to ''N'', where ''N'' is the total number of ports. For port ''n'', the associated S-parameter definition is in terms of incident and reflected 'power waves', &lt;math&gt;a_n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

Kurokawa&lt;ref&gt;Kurokawa, K., &quot;Power Waves and the Scattering Matrix&quot;, IEEE Trans. Micr. Theory &amp; Tech., Mar. 1965, pp. 194-202&lt;/ref&gt; defines the incident power wave for each port as

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{1}{2}\, k (V + Z_{p} I)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the reflected wave for each port is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{2}\, k (V - Z_{p}^{*} I)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal matrix of the complex reference impedance for each port, &lt;math&gt;Z_p^{*}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the elementwise complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;Z_p\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the column vectors of the voltages and currents at each port and

:&lt;math&gt;k = \left(\sqrt{\left|\real\{Z_{p}\}\right|}\right)^{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes it is useful to assume that the reference impedance is the same for all ports in which case the definitions of the incident and reflected waves may be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{1}{2}\, \frac{(V + Z_{0} I)}{\sqrt{\left|\real\{Z_{0}\}\right|}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{1}{2}\, \frac{(V - Z_{0}^{*} I)}{\sqrt{\left|\real\{Z_{0}\}\right|}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For all ports the reflected power waves may be defined in terms of the S-parameter matrix and the incident power waves by the following matrix equation:

:&lt;math&gt;b = S a\,&lt;/math&gt;

where S is an ''N'' x ''N'' matrix the elements of which can be indexed using conventional [[matrix (mathematics)]] notation.

===Reciprocity===
A network will be [[Reciprocity theorem (electrical circuits)|reciprocal]] if it is [[passive components|passive]] and it contains only reciprocal materials that influence the transmitted signal. For example, attenuators, cables, splitters and combiners are all reciprocal networks and &lt;math&gt;S_{mn} = S_{nm}\,&lt;/math&gt; in each case, or the S-parameter matrix will be equal to its [[transpose]]. Networks which include non-reciprocal materials in the transmission medium such as those containing [[biasing (electronics)|magnetically biased]] [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] components will be non-reciprocal. An amplifier is another example of a non-reciprocal network.

An interesting property of 3-port networks, however, is that they cannot be simultaneously reciprocal, loss-free, and perfectly matched.&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (2005) (op. cit.); p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lossless networks===
A lossless network is one which does not dissipate any power, or: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\left|a_n\right|^2 = \Sigma\left|b_n\right|^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. The sum of the incident powers at all ports is equal to the sum of the reflected powers at all ports. This implies that the S-parameter matrix is [[unitary matrix|unitary]], that is &lt;math&gt;(S)^H (S) = (I)\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(S)^H\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conjugate transpose]] of &lt;math&gt;(S)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(I)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]].

===Lossy networks===
A [[lossy]] passive network is one in which the sum of the incident powers at all ports is greater than the sum of the reflected powers at all ports. It therefore dissipates power, or: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\left|a_n\right|^2 \ne \Sigma\left|b_n\right|^2\,&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\left|a_n\right|^2 &gt; \Sigma\left|b_n\right|^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(I) - (S)^H (S)\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]].

==Two-Port S-Parameters==

The S-parameter matrix for the 2-port network is probably the most commonly used and serves as the basic building block for generating the higher order matrices for larger networks.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the relationship between the reflected, incident power waves and the S-parameter matrix is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} S_{11} &amp; S_{12} \\ S_{21} &amp; S_{22} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Expanding the matrices into equations gives:

:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = S_{11}a_1 +S_{12}a_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = S_{21}a_1 +S_{22}a_2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Each equation gives the relationship between the reflected and incident power waves at each of the network ports, 1 and 2, in terms of the network's individual S-parameters, &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt;. If one considers an incident power wave at port 1 (&lt;math&gt;a_1\,&lt;/math&gt;) there may result from it waves exiting from either port 1 itself (&lt;math&gt;b_1\,&lt;/math&gt;) or port 2 (&lt;math&gt;b_2\,&lt;/math&gt;). However if, according to the definition of S-parameters, port 2 is terminated in a load identical to the system impedance (&lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt;) then, by the [[Maximum power theorem|maximum power transfer theorem]], &lt;math&gt;b_2\,&lt;/math&gt; will be totally absorbed making &lt;math&gt;a_2\,&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero. Therefore, defining the incident voltage waves as &lt;math&gt;a_1 = V_1^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2 = V_2^+&lt;/math&gt; with the reflected waves being &lt;math&gt;b_1 = V_1^-&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2 = V_2^-&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;S_{11} = \frac{b_1}{a_1} = \frac{V_1^-}{V_1^+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{21} = \frac{b_2}{a_1} = \frac{V_2^-}{V_1^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if port 1 is terminated in the system impedance then &lt;math&gt;a_1\,&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero, giving

:&lt;math&gt;S_{12} = \frac{b_1}{a_2} = \frac{V_1^-}{V_2^+}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22} = \frac{b_2}{a_2} = \frac{V_2^-}{V_2^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Each 2-port S-parameter has the following generic descriptions:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the input port voltage reflection coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reverse voltage gain
:&lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the forward voltage gain
:&lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the output port voltage reflection coefficient.

If, instead of defining the voltage wave direction relative to each port, they are defined by their absolute direction as forward &lt;math&gt;V^+&lt;/math&gt; and reverse &lt;math&gt;V^-&lt;/math&gt; waves then &lt;math&gt;b_2 = V_2^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2 = V_2^-&lt;/math&gt;. The S-parameters then take on a more intuitive meaning such as the forward voltage gain being defined by the ratio of the forward voltages &lt;math&gt;S_{21} = V_2^+/V_1^+&lt;/math&gt;.

==S-Parameter properties of 2-port networks==
An amplifier operating under linear (small signal) conditions is a good example of a non-reciprocal network and a matched attenuator is an example of a reciprocal network. In the following cases we will assume that the input and output connections are to ports 1 and 2 respectively which is the most common convention. The nominal system impedance, frequency and any other factors which may influence the device, such as temperature, must also be specified.

===Complex linear gain===
The complex linear gain G is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G = S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

That is simply the voltage gain as a linear ratio of the output voltage divided by the input voltage, all values expressed as complex quantities.

===Scalar linear gain===
The scalar linear gain (or linear gain magnitude) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left|G\right| = \left|S_{21}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt;.

That is simply the scalar voltage gain as a linear ratio of the output voltage and the input voltage. As this is a scalar quantity, the phase is not relevant in this case.

===Scalar logarithmic gain===
The scalar logarithmic (decibel or dB) expression for gain (g) is

:&lt;math&gt;g = 20\log_{10}\left|S_{21}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

This is more commonly used than scalar linear gain and a positive quantity is normally understood as simply a 'gain'... A negative quantity can be expressed as a 'negative gain' or more usually as a 'loss' equivalent to its magnitude in dB. For example, a 10 m length of cable may have a gain of - 1 dB at 100&amp;nbsp;MHz or a loss of 1 dB at 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.

===Insertion loss===
In case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss ({{math|''IL''}}) is the magnitude of the transmission coefficient {{math|{{!}}''S&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;''{{!}}}} expressed in decibels. It is thus given by:&lt;ref&gt;Collin, Robert E.; ''Foundations For Microwave Engineering, Second Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;IL = -20\log_{10}\left|S_{21}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

It is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the [[device under test]] (DUT) between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. Notice that the extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive. The negative of insertion loss expressed in decibels is defined as insertion gain.

===Input return loss===
Input [[return loss]] ({{math|''RL''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;}}) can be thought of as a measure of how close the actual input impedance of the network is to the nominal system impedance value. Input return loss expressed in [[decibel]]s is given by

:&lt;math&gt;RL_\mathrm{in} = 10\log_{10}\left| \frac{1}{S_{11}^2} \right| = - 20\log_{10} \left| S_{11}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

Note that for passive two-port networks in which {{math|{{!}}''S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''{{!}}&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1}}, it follows that return loss is a non-negative quantity: {{math|''RL&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0}}. Also note that somewhat confusingly, [[Return loss#Sign|return loss]] is sometimes used as the negative of the quantity defined above, but this usage is, strictly speaking, incorrect based on the definition of loss.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;Trevor S. Bird, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5162049 &quot;Definition and Misuse of Return Loss&quot;], ''IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Magazine'', '''vol.51''', iss.2, pp.166-167, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Output return loss===
The output return loss ({{math|''RL''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;}}) has a similar definition to the input return loss but applies to the output port (port 2) instead of the input port. It is given by

:&lt;math&gt;RL_\mathrm{out} = - 20\log_{10}\left|S_{22}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

===Reverse gain and reverse isolation===
The scalar logarithmic (decibel or dB) expression for reverse gain (&lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{rev}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is:

:&lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{rev} = 20\log_{10}\left|S_{12}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

Often this will be expressed as reverse isolation (&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{rev}\,&lt;/math&gt;) in which case it becomes a positive quantity equal to the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{rev}\,&lt;/math&gt; and the expression becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{rev} =  \left|g_\mathrm{rev}\right|   = \left|20\log_{10}\left|S_{12}\right|\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; dB.

===Voltage reflection coefficient===
The voltage reflection coefficient at the input port (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in}\,&lt;/math&gt;) or at the output port (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{out}\,&lt;/math&gt;) are equivalent to &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively, so

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in} = S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{out} = S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

As &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; are complex quantities, so are &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{out}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Voltage reflection coefficients are complex quantities and may be graphically represented on polar diagrams or Smith Charts

See also the [[Reflection Coefficient]] article.

===Voltage standing wave ratio===
The voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) at a port, represented by the lower case 's', is a similar measure of port match to return loss but is a scalar linear quantity, the ratio of the standing wave maximum voltage to the standing wave minimum voltage. It therefore relates to the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient and hence to the magnitude of either &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; for the input port or &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; for the output port.

At the input port, the VSWR (&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{in}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{in} = \frac{1+\left|S_{11}\right|}{1-\left|S_{11}\right|}\,&lt;/math&gt;

At the output port, the VSWR (&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{out}\,&lt;/math&gt;) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{out} = \frac{1+\left|S_{22}\right|}{1-\left|S_{22}\right|}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is correct for reflection coefficients with a magnitude no greater than unity, which is usually the case.  A reflection coefficient with a magnitude greater than unity, such as in a [[Negative resistance#Amplifiers|tunnel diode amplifier]], will result in a negative value for this expression.  VSWR, however, from its definition, is always positive.  A more correct expression for port ''k'' of a multiport is;

:&lt;math&gt;s_k = \frac{1+\left|S_{kk}\right|}{|1-\left|S_{kk}\right||}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==4-Port S-Parameters==
4 Port S Parameters are used to characterize 4 port networks.  They include information regarding the reflected and incident power waves between the 4 ports of the network.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}S_{11} &amp; S_{12} &amp; S_{13} &amp; S_{14} \\ S_{21} &amp; S_{22} &amp; S_{23} &amp; S_{24} \\ S_{31} &amp; S_{32} &amp; S_{33} &amp; S_{34} \\ S_{41} &amp; S_{42} &amp; S_{43} &amp; S_{44} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

They are commonly used to analyze a pair of coupled transmission lines to determine the amount of cross-talk between them, if they are driven by two separate single ended signals, or the reflected and incident power of a differential signal driven across them.  Many specifications of high speed differential signals define a communication channel in terms of the 4-Port S-Parameters, for example the 10-Gigabit Attachment Unit Interface (XAUI), SATA, PCI-X, and InfiniBand systems.

===4-Port Mixed-Mode S-Parameters===
4-Port mixed-Mode S-Parameters characterize a 4 port network in terms of the response of the network to common mode and differential stimulus signals.  The following table displays the 4-Port Mixed-Mode S-Parameters.

Note the format of the parameter notation SXYab, where “S” stands for scattering parameter or S-parameter, “X” is the response mode (differential or common), “Y” is the stimulus mode (differential or common), “a” is the response (output) port and b is the stimulus (input) port. This is the typical nomenclature for scattering parameters.

The first quadrant is defined as the upper left 4 parameters describing the differential stimulus and differential response characteristics of the device under test. This is the actual mode of operation for most high-speed differential interconnects and is the quadrant that receives the most attention. It includes input differential return loss (SDD11), input differential insertion loss (SDD21), output differential return loss (SDD22) and output differential insertion loss (SDD12). Some benefits of differential signal processing are;
* reduced electromagnetic interference susceptibility
* reduction in electromagnetic radiation from balanced differential circuit
* even order differential distortion products transformed to common mode signals
* factor of two increase in voltage level relative to single-ended
* rejection to common mode supply and ground noise encoding onto differential signal

The second and third quadrants are the upper right and lower left 4 parameters, respectively. These are also referred to as the cross-mode quadrants. This is because they fully characterize any mode conversion occurring in the device under test, whether it is common-to-differential SDCab conversion (EMI susceptibility for an intended differential signal SDD transmission application) or differential-to-common SCDab conversion (EMI radiation for a differential application). Understanding mode conversion is very helpful when trying to optimize the design of interconnects for gigabit data throughput.

The fourth quadrant is the lower right 4 parameters and describes the performance characteristics of the common-mode signal SCCab propagating through the device under test. For a properly designed SDDab differential device there should be minimal common-mode output SCCab. However, the fourth quadrant common-mode response data is a measure of common-mode transmission response and used in a ratio with the differential transmission response to determine the network common-mode rejection. This common mode rejection is an important benefit of differential signal processing and can be reduced to one in some differential circuit implementations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcon.com/media/2005/Euro/5-TA3--John_DAmbrosia.pdf ''Backplane Channels and Correlation Between Their Frequency and Time Domain Performance'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockelman, DE and Eisenstadt, WR &quot;Combined differential and common-mode scattering parameters: theory and simulation,&quot; MTT, IEEE transactions volume 43 issue 7 part 1–2 July 1995 pages 1530-1539&lt;/ref&gt;

==S-parameters in amplifier design==
The reverse isolation parameter &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; determines the level of feedback from the output of an amplifier to the input and therefore influences its stability (its tendency to refrain from oscillation) together with the forward gain &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;. An amplifier with input and output ports perfectly isolated from each other would have infinite scalar log magnitude isolation or the linear magnitude of &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; would be zero. Such an amplifier is said to be unilateral. Most practical amplifiers though will have some finite isolation allowing the reflection coefficient 'seen' at the input to be influenced to some extent by the load connected on the output. An amplifier which is deliberately designed to have the smallest possible value of &lt;math&gt;\left|S_{12}\right|\,&lt;/math&gt; is often called a [[buffer amplifier]].

Suppose the output port of a real (non-unilateral or bilateral) amplifier is connected to an arbitrary load with a reflection coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\rho_{L}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The actual reflection coefficient 'seen' at the input port &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in}\,&lt;/math&gt; will be given by&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (1997); ''Microwave Transistor Amplifiers Analysis and Design, Second Edition''; Prentice Hall NJ; pp 212-216. ISBN 0-13-254335-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in} = S_{11} + \frac{S_{12}S_{21}\rho_L}{1-S_{22}\rho_L}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

If the amplifier is unilateral then &lt;math&gt;S_{12} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{in} = S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; or, to put it another way, the output loading has no effect on the input.

A similar property exists in the opposite direction, in this case if &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{out}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection coefficient seen at the output port and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{s}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection coefficient of the source connected to the input port.

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{out} = S_{22} + \frac{S_{12}S_{21}\rho_s}{1-S_{11}\rho_s}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Port loading conditions for an amplifier to be unconditionally stable===
An amplifier is unconditionally stable if a load or source of ''any'' reflection coefficient can be connected without causing instability.  This condition occurs if the magnitudes of the reflection coefficients at the source, load and the amplifier's input and output ports are simultaneously less than unity. An important requirement that is often overlooked is that the amplifier be a linear network with no poles in the right half plane.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Rollett, &quot;Stability and Power-Gain Invariants of Linear Two-Ports&quot;, IRE Trans. on Circuit Theory vol. CT-9, pp. 29-32, March 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Instability can cause severe distortion of the amplifier's gain frequency response or, in the extreme, oscillation. To be unconditionally stable at the frequency of interest, an amplifier must satisfy the following 4 equations simultaneously:&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, Guillermo (op. cit.); pp 217-222&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_S\right| &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_L\right| &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_\mathrm{in}\right| &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_\mathrm{out}\right| &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary condition for when each of these values is equal to unity may be represented by a circle drawn on the polar diagram representing the (complex) reflection coefficient, one for the input port and the other for the output port. Often these will be scaled as Smith Charts. In each case coordinates of the circle centre and the associated radius are given by the following equations:

====&lt;math&gt;\rho_{L}\,&lt;/math&gt; values for &lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_{in}\right| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt; (output stability circle)====
Radius &lt;math&gt;r_L = \left| \frac{S_{12}S_{21}}{\left|S_{22}\right|^2-\left|\Delta\right|^2} \right|\,&lt;/math&gt;

Center &lt;math&gt;c_L = \frac{(S_{22} - \Delta S_{11}^*)^*}{\left|S_{22}\right|^2-\left|\Delta\right|^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====&lt;math&gt;\rho_{S}\,&lt;/math&gt; values for &lt;math&gt;\left|\rho_{out}\right| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt; (input stability circle)====
Radius &lt;math&gt;r_s = \left| \frac{S_{12}S_{21}}{\left|S_{11}\right|^2-\left|\Delta\right|^2} \right|\,&lt;/math&gt;

Center &lt;math&gt;c_s = \frac{(S_{11} - \Delta S_{22}^*)^*}{\left|S_{11}\right|^2-\left|\Delta\right|^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, in both cases

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = S_{11}S_{22} - S_{12}S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the superscript star (*) indicates a [[complex conjugate]].

The circles are in complex units of reflection coefficient so may be drawn on impedance or admittance based Smith Charts normalised to the system impedance. This serves to readily show the regions of normalised impedance (or admittance) for predicted unconditional stability. Another way of demonstrating unconditional stability is by means of the Rollet stability factor (&lt;math&gt;K\,&lt;/math&gt;), defined as

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1-\left|S_{11}\right|^2-\left|S_{22}\right|^2+\left|\Delta\right|^2}{2\left|S_{12}S_{21}\right|}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The condition of unconditional stability is achieved when &lt;math&gt;K&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left|\Delta\right|&lt;1\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Scattering transfer parameters===
The Scattering transfer parameters or T-parameters of a 2-port network are expressed by the T-parameter matrix and are closely related to the corresponding S-parameter matrix. The T-parameter matrix is related to the incident and reflected normalised waves at each of the ports as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\ a_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} T_{11} &amp; T_{12} \\ T_{21} &amp; T_{22} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} a_2 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;

However, they could be defined differently, as follows :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a_1 \\ b_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} T_{11} &amp; T_{12} \\ T_{21} &amp; T_{22} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} b_2 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}\, &lt;/math&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several books (for example &quot;Network scattering parameters&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) use this last definition, so caution is necessary. The &quot;From S to T&quot; and &quot;From T to S&quot; paragraphs in this article are based on the first definition. Adaptation to the second definition is trivial (interchanging T&lt;small&gt;11&lt;/small&gt; for T&lt;small&gt;22&lt;/small&gt;, and T&lt;small&gt;12&lt;/small&gt; for &lt;small&gt;T21&lt;/small&gt;).
The advantage of T-parameters compared to S-parameters is that they may be used to readily determine the effect of cascading 2 or more 2-port networks by simply multiplying the associated individual T-parameter matrices. If the T-parameters of say three different 2-port networks 1, 2 and 3 are &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}T_1\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}T_2\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}T_3\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively then the T-parameter matrix for the cascade of all three networks (&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}T_T\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;) in serial order is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}T_T\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}T_1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}T_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}T_3\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;

As with S-parameters, T-parameters are complex values and there is a direct conversion between the two types. Although the cascaded T-parameters is a simple matrix multiplication of the individual T-parameters, the conversion for each network's S-parameters to the corresponding T-parameters and the conversion of the cascaded T-parameters back to the equivalent cascaded S-parameters, which are usually required, is not trivial. However once the operation is completed, the complex full wave interactions between all ports in both directions will be taken into account. The following equations will provide conversion between S and T parameters for 2-port networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5952-1087.pdf ''S-Parameter Design''; Application Note AN 154; Agilent Technologies; p 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

From S to T:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{11} = \frac{-\det \begin{pmatrix}S\end{pmatrix}}{S_{21}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_{12} = \frac{S_{11}}{S_{21}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_{21} = \frac{-S_{22}}{S_{21}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_{22} = \frac{1}{S_{21}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

From T to S

:&lt;math&gt;S_{11} = \frac{T_{12}}{T_{22}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{12} = \frac{\det \begin{pmatrix}T\end{pmatrix}}{T_{22}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{21} = \frac{1}{T_{22}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{22} = \frac{-T_{21}}{T_{22}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\det \begin{pmatrix}S\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt; indicates the [[determinant]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}S\end{pmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==1-port S-parameters==
The S-parameter for a 1-port network is given by a simple 1 x 1 matrix of the form &lt;math&gt;(s_{nn})\,&lt;/math&gt; where n is the allocated port number. To comply with the S-parameter definition of linearity, this would normally be a passive load of some type.

==Higher-order S-parameter matrices==
Higher order S-parameters for pairs of dissimilar ports (&lt;math&gt;S_{mn}\,&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;m \ne \; n\,&lt;/math&gt; may be deduced similarly to those for 2-port networks by considering pairs of ports in turn, in each case ensuring that all of the remaining (unused) ports are loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance. In this way the incident power wave for each of the unused ports becomes zero yielding similar expressions to those obtained for the 2-port case. S-parameters relating to single ports only (&lt;math&gt;S_{mm}\,&lt;/math&gt;) require all of the remaining ports to be loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance therefore making all of the incident power waves zero except that for the port under consideration. In general therefore we have:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{mn} = \frac{b_m}{a_n}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;S_{mm} = \frac{b_m}{a_m}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 3-port network such as a 2-way splitter would have the following S-parameter definitions

:&lt;math&gt;S_{11} = \frac{b_1}{a_1} = \frac{V_1^-}{V_1^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{33} = \frac{b_3}{a_3} = \frac{V_3^-}{V_3^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{32} = \frac{b_3}{a_2} = \frac{V_3^-}{V_2^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{23} = \frac{b_2}{a_3} = \frac{V_2^-}{V_3^+}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Measurement of S-parameters==
[[File:vna3.png|thumb|400px|The basic parts of a vector network analyzer]]

===Vector network analyzer===
The diagram shows the essential parts of a typical 2-port [[network analyzer (electrical)|vector network analyzer]] (VNA). The two ports of the [[device under test]] (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The test port connectors provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable connector adaptors A1 and A2 respectively.

The test frequency is generated by a variable frequency [[carrier wave|CW]] source and its power level is set using a variable [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]]. The position of switch SW1 sets the direction that the test signal passes through the DUT. Initially consider that SW1 is at position 1 so that the test signal is incident on the DUT at P1 which is appropriate for measuring &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;. The test signal is fed by SW1 to the common port of splitter 1, one arm (the reference channel) feeding a reference receiver for P1 (RX REF1) and the other (the test channel) connecting to P1 via the [[directional coupler]] DC1, PC1 and A1. The third port of DC1 couples off the power reflected from P1 via A1 and PC1, then feeding it to test receiver 1 (RX TEST1). Similarly, signals leaving P2 pass via A2, PC2 and DC2 to RX TEST2. RX REF1, RX TEST1, RX REF2 and RXTEST2 are known as [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] receivers as they share the same reference oscillator, and they are capable of measuring the test signal's amplitude ''and'' phase at the test frequency. All of the complex receiver output signals are fed to a processor which does the mathematical processing and displays the chosen parameters and format on the phase and amplitude display. The [[instantaneous]] value of phase includes both the [[Time|temporal]] and [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] parts, but the former is removed by virtue of using 2 test channels, one as a reference and the other for measurement. When SW1 is set to position 2, the test signals are applied to P2, the reference is measured by RX REF2, reflections from P2 are coupled off by DC2 and measured by RX TEST2 and signals leaving P1 are coupled off by DC1 and measured by RX TEST1. This position is appropriate for measuring &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Calibration===
Prior to making a VNA S-parameter measurement, the first essential step is to perform an accurate [[calibration]] appropriate to the intended measurements. Several types of calibration are normally available on the VNA. It is only in the last few years that VNAs have had the sufficiently advanced processing capability, at realistic cost, required to accomplish the more advanced types of calibration, including corrections for [[systematic errors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5965-7709E.pdf ''Applying Error Correction to Network Analyzer Measurements''; Agilent Application Note AN 1287-3, Agilent Technologies; p6]&lt;/ref&gt; The more basic types, often called 'response' calibrations, may be performed quickly but will only provide a result with moderate [[uncertainty]]. For improved uncertainty and [[dynamic range]] of the measurement a full 2 port calibration is required prior to DUT measurement. This will effectively eliminate all sources of systematic errors inherent in the VNA measurement system.

===Minimization of systematic errors===
Systematic errors are those which do not vary with time during a calibration. For a set of 2 port S-parameter measurements there are a total of 12 types of systematic errors which are measured and removed mathematically as part of the full 2 port calibration procedure. They are, for each port:

1. [[directivity]] and [[crosstalk]]&lt;br&gt;
2. source and [[Electrical load|load]] [[impedance matching|mismatches]]&lt;br&gt;
3. [[frequency response]] errors caused by reflection and transmission tracking within the test receivers

The calibration procedure requires initially setting up the VNA with all the cables, adaptors and connectors necessary to connect to the DUT but not at this stage connecting it. A calibration kit is used according to the connector types fitted to the DUT. This will normally include adaptors, nominal short circuits (SCs), open circuits (OCs) and load termination (TERM) standards of both connector sexes appropriate to the VNA and DUT connectors. Even with standards of high quality, when performing tests at the higher frequencies into the microwave range various stray capacitances and inductances will become apparent and cause uncertainty during the calibration.  Data relating to the strays of the particular calibration kit used are measured at the factory traceable to [[Standards organization|national standards]] and the results are programmed into the VNA memory prior to performing the calibration.

The calibration procedure is normally software controlled, and instructs the operator to fit various calibration standards to the ends of the DUT connecting cables as well as making a through connection. At each step the VNA processor captures data across the test frequency range and stores it. At the end of the calibration procedure, the processor uses the stored data thus obtained to apply the systematic error corrections to all subsequent measurements made. All subsequent measurements are known as 'corrected measurements'. At this point the DUT is connected and a corrected measurement of its S-parameters made.

===Output format of measured and corrected S-parameter data===
The S-parameter test data may be provided in many alternative formats, for example: list, graphical ([[Smith chart]] or [[Complex plane|polar diagram]]).

===List format===
In list format the measured and corrected S-parameters are tabulated against frequency. The most common list format is known as Touchstone or SNP, where N is the number of ports. Commonly text files containing this information would have the filename extension '.s2p'. An example of a [[Touchstone file]] listing for the full 2-port S-parameter data obtained for a device is shown below:

Rows beginning with an exclamation mark contains only comments. The row beginning with the hash symbol indicates that in this case frequencies are in megahertz (MHZ), S-parameters are listed (S), magnitudes are in dB log magnitude (DB) and the system impedance is 50 Ohm (R 50). There are 9 columns of data. Column 1 is the test frequency in megahertz in this case. Columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the magnitudes of &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively in dB. Columns 3, 5, 7 and 9 are the angles of &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively in degrees.

===Graphical (Smith chart)===
Any 2-port S-parameter may be displayed on a [[Smith chart]] using polar co-ordinates, but the most meaningful would be &lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt; since either of these may be converted directly into an equivalent normalized impedance (or admittance) using the characteristic Smith Chart impedance (or admittance) scaling appropriate to the system impedance.

===Graphical (polar diagram)===
Any 2-port S-parameter may be displayed on a polar diagram using polar co-ordinates.

In either graphical format each S-parameter at a particular test frequency is displayed as a dot. If the measurement is a sweep across several frequencies a dot will appear for each. Many VNAs connect successive dots with straight lines for easier visibility.

===Measuring S-parameters of a one-port network===
The S-parameter matrix for a network with just one port will have just one element represented in the form &lt;math&gt;S_{nn}\,&lt;/math&gt;, where n is the number allocated to the port. Most VNAs provide a simple one-port calibration capability for one port measurement to save time if that is all that is required.

===Measuring S-parameters of networks with more than 2 ports===
VNAs designed for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk of this approach is that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be as close as possible to a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.

Assuming that the extra loads are specified adequately, if necessary, two or more of the S-parameter subscripts are modified from those relating to the VNA (1 and 2 in the case considered above) to those relating to the network under test (1 to N, if N is the total number of DUT ports). For example, if the DUT has 5 ports and a two port VNA is connected with VNA port 1 to DUT port 3 and VNA port 2 to DUT port 5, the measured VNA results (&lt;math&gt;S_{11}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{22}\,&lt;/math&gt;) would be equivalent to &lt;math&gt;S_{33}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{35}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_{53}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{55}\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively, assuming that DUT ports 1, 2 and 4 were terminated in adequate 50 Ohm loads . This would provide 4 of the necessary 25 S-parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2193">In the [[electronics]] industry, a '''second source''' is a company that is licensed to manufacture and sell components originally designed by another company (the first source).&lt;ref&gt;John Zysman, Laura Tyson , ''American Industry in International Competition: Government Policies And Corporate Strategies'', Cornell University Press, 1984 ISBN 0-8014-9297-1 page 160 &lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for engineers and purchasers to avoid components that are only available from a single source, to avoid the risk that a problem with the supplier would cause a popular and profitable product to be unable to be manufactured.  For simple components such as resistors and transistors, this is not usually an issue, but for complex [[integrated circuit]]s, vendors often react by licensing one or more other companies to manufacture and sell the same parts as second sources.  While the details of such licenses are usually confidential, they often involve cross-licensing, so that the original company also obtains the right to manufacture and sell parts designed by the second source.

==Examples==
[[MOS Technology]] licensed [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] and [[Synertek]] to second source the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor and support components.

[[Intel]] licensed [[AMD]] to second source Intel microprocessors such as the [[Intel 8086|8086]] and its related support components.  This second source agreement is particularly famous for leading to much [[litigation]] between the two parties.  The agreement gave AMD the rights to second source later Intel parts, but Intel refused to provide the masks for the [[Intel 80386|386]] to AMD.  AMD reverse engineered the 386, and Intel then claimed that AMD's license to the 386 [[microcode]] only allowed AMD to &quot;use&quot; the microcode but not to sell products incorporating it.  The courts eventually decided in favor of AMD. &lt;ref&gt; Michael J.

[[Image:Regulated rectifier.gif|thumb|right|Thyristor voltage regulated by phase control]]

'''Phase control''' ('''PFC'''), also called '''phase cutting''', is a method of [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) for power limiting, applied to [[Alternating current|AC]] voltages.  It works by modulating a [[thyristor]], [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]], [[TRIAC|triac]], [[thyratron]], or other such gated [[diode]]-like devices into and out of conduction at a predetermined phase of the applied waveform.

== Overview ==

Phase fired control is often used to control the amount of [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]] or [[Power (physics)|power]] that a [[power supply]] feeds to its load.  It does this in much the same way that a [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] (PWM) supply would pulse on and off to create an average value at its output. If the supply has a DC output, its time base is of no importance in deciding when to pulse the supply on or off, as the value that will be pulsed on and off is continuous.

PFC differs from PWM in that it addresses supplies that output a modulated waveform, such as the sinusoidal [[Alternating current|AC]] waveform that the national grid outputs.  Here, it becomes important for the supply to pulse on and off at the correct position in the modulation cycle for a known value to be achieved; for example, the controller could turn on at the peak of a waveform or at its base if the cycle's time base were not taken into consideration.

Phase-fired controllers take their name from that fact that they trigger a pulse of output at a certain phase of the input's modulation cycle.  In essence, a PFC is a PWM controller that can synchronise itself with the modulation present at the input.

Most phase fired controllers use thyristors or other solid state switching devices as their control elements.  Thyristor-based controllers may utilise [[gate turn-off thyristor|gate turn-off (GTO) thyristors]], allowing the controller to not only decide when to switch the output on but when to turn it off, rather than having to wait for the waveform to return to zero.

===Output reduction by bucking===

A phase fired controller, like a buck topology [[switched-mode power supply]], is only able to deliver an output maximum equal to that which is present at its input, minus any losses occurring in the control elements themselves.  Provided the modulation during each cycle is predictable or repetitive, as it is on the national grid's AC mains, to obtain an output lower than its input, a phase fired control simply switches off for a given phase angle of the input's modulation cycle.  By triggering the device into conduction at a phase angle greater than 0 degrees, a point after the modulation cycle starts, a fraction of the total energy within each cycle is present at the output.

===&quot;Boosting&quot; by derating===

To achieve a &quot;boost&quot;-like effect, the PFC designs must be derated such that maximum present at the input is higher than the nominal output requirements.  When the supply is first turned on or operating under nominal conditions, the controller will continually be delivering less than 100% of its input.  When a boost is required, the controller delivers a percentage closer to 100% of the maximum input available.

Derating of mains powered, phase fired controllers is important as they are often used to control [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] loads, such as heating elements.  Over time, the resistance of heating elements can increase.  To account for this, a phase fired control must be able to provide some degree of extra voltage to draw the same heating current through the element.  The only way of achieving this is to purposely design the supply to require less than 100% of the input's modulation cycle when the elements are first put in place, progressively opening the supply up towards delivering 100% of the input modulation cycle as the elements age.

===Applications===

Previously, extremely expensive and heavy multi-tapped [[transformer]]s were used as the supplies for such elements, with the corresponding winding tap being connected to the element to produce the desired temperature.  This limited the temperature resolution to the number of tap combinations available.  They often find their way into controllers designed for equipment such as electric ovens and furnaces.

In modern, usually high power, equipment, the transformer is replaced with phase-fired controllers connecting the load directly to the mains, resulting in a substantially cheaper and lighter system.  However, the method is usually limited to use in equipment that would be unrealistic without it.  This is because removal of the mains transformer means that the load has electrical continuity with the input.  For industrial ovens and furnaces the input is often the national grid AC, which is itself electrically referenced to ground.  With the controller's output referenced to ground, a user need only be in contact with earth and one of the output terminals to risk receiving an electrical shock.  With many high-power items of equipment running from three-phase 415 V, high current inputs and having any enclosure or framework present earthed (grounded), this is a serious risk that must be carefully assessed.

===History===
The first patent for phase-fired controllers derives from 1912. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However realization was first possible in the 1920s, when [[mercury-arc valve]] rectifiers with control grids became available.
However, this method of voltage regulation was not common at the time, because of the limitations of mercury arc valves. It became widespread with the invention of solid-state [[thyristor]]s at the end of the 1950s.

      <comment>Disambiguated: [[push-pull]] → [[Push–pull output]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''Phase inversion''' is the swapping of the two poles of an [[alternating current]] source. A phase inversion is neither a time shift nor a phase shift, but simply a swap of plus and minus.

For example, in a [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] [[power amplifier]] using [[vacuum tube]]s, the signal is most often ''split'' by a [[phase splitter]] (aka phase inverter) stage which produces two signals, one ''in phase'', and the other ''out of phase'', that is, phase inverted. These two signals then drive the two halves of the first push-pull stage, which may be either the output stage (in which case the phase splitter will be in between the driver stage if there is one and the output stage) or the driver stage. The other common arrangements for driving a push-pull stage are by using an [[isolation transformer]] to produce the split signals, or by using the in-phase half of the first push-pull stage to drive the other half. A common circuit using this last technique is the [[long-tailed pair]], often seen in [[television set]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s. 

In [[solid state electronics]] all of these techniques can be used, and phase inversion can also be produced by the use of NPN/PNP complementary circuitry, which has no corresponding technique in vacuum tube designs.       

Phase inversion may occur with a random or periodic, symmetrical or non-symmetrical [[waveform]], although it is usually produced by the inversion of a symmetrical periodic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]], resulting in a change in sign. A symmetrical periodic signal represented by ''f'' (''t'' ) = ''A'' e&lt;sup&gt;j''ωt''&lt;/sup&gt;, after phase inversion, becomes ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'' ) = Ae&lt;sup&gt;j(ω''t'' +π)&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''t'' is [[time]], ''A'' is the magnitude of the vector, ω is angular [[frequency]] (ω = 2π''f'' ), where ''f'' is the frequency and π ≈3.1416 and e ≈ 2.7183. The algebraic sum of ''f'' (''t'' ) and ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'' ) will always be zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2890">'''Selectivity''' is a measure of the [[performance]] of a [[radio]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] to respond only to the radio [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] it is tuned to (such as a [[radio station]]) and reject other signals nearby in [[frequency]], such as another [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on an [[adjacent channel]].

Selectivity is usually measured as a [[ratio]] in [[decibel]]s (dBs), comparing the [[signal strength]] received against that of a similar signal on another [[frequency]]. If the signal is at the adjacent channel of the selected signal, this [[measurement]] is also known as '''adjacent-channel rejection ratio''' ('''ACRR''').

Selectivity also provides some immunity to [[blanketing]] interference.

[[LC circuit]]s are often used as filters; the [[Q factor|Q]] (&quot;Quality&quot; factor) determines the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of each LC [[tuned circuit]] in the radio. The L/C ratio, in turn, determines their Q and so their selectivity, because the rest of the circuit - the aerial or amplifier feeding the tuned circuit for example - will contain present resistance. For a series resonant circuit, the higher the inductance and the lower the capacitance, the narrower the filter bandwidth (meaning the [[reactance]] of the inductance, L, and the capacitance, C, at [[resonant frequency]] will be relatively high compared with the series source/load resistances). For a parallel resonant circuit the opposite applies; small inductances reduce the [[damping]] of external circuitry.

There are practical limits to the increase in selectivity with changing L/C ratio:
*tuning capacitors of large values can be difficult to construct
*stray capacitance, and capacitance within the transistors or valves of associated circuitry, may become significant (and vary with time)
*the series resistance internal to the wire in the coil, may be significant (for parallel tuned circuits especially)
*large inductances imply physically large (and expensive coils) and/or thinner wire (hence worse internal resistance).

Therefore other methods may be used to increase selectivity, such as [[Positive feedback|Q multiplier]] circuits and [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative receivers]]. [[Superheterodyne receiver]]s  allow use one or more fixed [[intermediate frequency]] tuned circuits for selectivity. Fixed tuning eliminates the requirement that multiple tuning stages accurately match while being adjusted. &lt;ref&gt;The American Radio Relay League: &quot;The Radio Amateur's Handbook, 1968&quot;, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''output impedance''', '''source impedance''', or '''internal impedance''' of an electronic device is the opposition exhibited by its output terminals to an alternating current (AC) of a particular frequency as a result of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]]. It is the [[Thévenin equivalent]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] looking back into the output terminals.

In the case of a [[nonlinear device]], such as a [[transistor]], the term &quot;output impedance&quot; usually refers to the effect upon a small-amplitude signal, and will vary with the [[bias point]] of the transistor, that is, with the direct current (DC) and voltage applied to the device.  

The small-signal impedance at DC (frequency of 0) is the same as the resistive component of the impedance and is termed '''output resistance'''.

No real device ([[Battery (electricity)|battery]], [[electrical generator|generator]], [[amplifier]]) is a perfect source; each has an internal impedance, though this may have little practical effect, depending on the circuit and the load.

Depending on perspective, this impedance can be modeled as being in series with an ideal [[voltage source]], or in parallel with an ideal [[current source]] (''see'': [[Thévenin's theorem]], [[Norton's theorem]], [[Series and parallel circuits]]). Both models are equivalent, and one may choose whichever model is most convenient for analysis.

For example, having a preamplifier with a 100-[[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] output impedance means the output voltage signal appears to be in series with a 100-ohm [[resistor]].

== Measurement ==
The source resistance of a purely resistive device can be experimentally determined by increasingly loading the device until the voltage across the load (AC or DC) is one half of the open circuit voltage.  At this point, the load resistance and internal resistance are equal. 

It can more accurately be described by keeping track of the voltage vs current curves for various loads, and calculating the resistance from [[Ohm's law]].  (The internal resistance may not be the same for different types of loading or at different frequencies, especially in devices like chemical batteries.)

The generalized source impedance for a reactive (inductive or capacitive) source device is more complicated to determine, and is usually measured with specialized instruments, rather than taking many measurements by hand.

== Audio amplifiers ==
[[Image:Source and load circuit Z.png]]

The real output impedance (Z&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;) of a [[power amplifier]] is usually less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;Ω, but this is rarely specified. Instead it is &quot;hidden&quot; within the [[damping factor]] parameter, which is:

:&lt;math&gt;
DF = \frac{Z_\mathrm{load}}{Z_\mathrm{source}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
Z_\mathrm{source} = \frac{Z_\mathrm{load}}{DF}
&lt;/math&gt;

gives the small source impedance (output impedance) of the power amplifier.  This can be calculated from the ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; of the loudspeaker (typically 2, 4, or 8 ohms) and the given value of the damping factor.

Generally in audio and [[hifi]], the input impedance of components is several times (technically, more than 10) the output impedance of the device connected to them.  This is called [[impedance bridging]] or voltage bridging.

In this case, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&gt; ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;, ''DF'' &gt; 10

In video, RF, and other systems, impedances of inputs and outputs are the same. This is called [[impedance matching]] or a matched connection.

In this case, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;, ''DF'' = 1/1 = 1 .

The actual output impedance for most devices is not the same as the rated output impedance.  A power amplifier may have a rated impedance of 8 ohms, but the actual output impedance will vary depending on circuit conditions. The rated output impedance is the impedance into which the amplifier can deliver its maximum amount of power without failing.

== Batteries ==
'''[[Internal resistance]]''' is a concept that helps model the electrical consequences of the complex chemical reactions inside a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].  It is impossible to directly measure the internal resistance of a battery, but it can be calculated from current and voltage data measured from a circuit. When a load is applied to a battery, the internal resistance can be calculated from the following equations:

&lt;math&gt;R_B=\left( \frac{Vs}{I} \right) - R_L&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;R_B=\left( \frac{V_S-V}{I} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;R_B&lt;/math&gt; is the internal resistance of the battery

&lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the battery voltage without a load

&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the battery voltage with a load

&lt;math&gt;R_L&lt;/math&gt; is the total resistance of the circuit

&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the total current supplied by the battery

Internal resistance varies with the age of a battery, but for most commercial batteries the internal resistance is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;ohm.

When there is a current through a cell, the measured [[Electromotive force|e.m.f.]] is lower than when there is no current delivered by the cell. The reason for this is that part of the available energy of the cell is used up to drive charges through the cell. This energy wasted by the so-called &quot;internal resistance&quot; of that cell. This wasted energy shows up as lost voltage.  Internal resistance is r = (E−V)/I .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">In [[electronics]], '''sense''' is a technique used in [[Power supply|power supplies]] to produce the correct [[voltage]] for a [[Electrical load|load]].  Although simple [[Battery (electronics)|batteries]] naturally maintain a steady voltage (except in cases of large [[internal impedance]]), a power supply must use a [[feedback]] system to make adjustments based on the difference between its intended output and its actual output. If this system is working, the latter will be very close to the former.

Two types of sense are used, depending on where the power supply output is measured.  In '''local sense,''' the supply simply measures the voltage at its output [[Terminal (electronics)|terminals]], where the [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] to the load connect.  This method has the problem of not accounting for the voltage drop due to [[Ohm's law|resistance]] of the leads, which is proportional to the amount of [[Electric current|current]] drawn by the load.  That is, the supply might be producing the correct voltage at its output terminals, but there will be a lower voltage at the input terminals of the load.

When this might cause a problem, '''remote sense''' can be used to force the power supply to counteract the voltage drop by raising the voltage at its output terminals.  If successful, it will exactly cancel the drop along the leads, yielding the correct voltage at the input terminals of the load.  This is accomplished by using separate &quot;sense leads,&quot; connected to the load's input terminals, to measure the output voltage.  (Because the sensing function draws only a very small amount of current, there is practically no additional voltage drop due to the sense leads themselves.)

Many power supplies that are equipped with remote sense can suffer catastrophic damage if turned on while the sense leads are unconnected.  To avoid this, some supplies are equipped with '''auto sense,''' which will automatically switch between local and remote sensing depending on whether the sense leads are correctly connected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1219">A '''discrete circuit''' is an [[electronic circuit]] built out of [[Discrete device|discrete components]], such as [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc., instead of a single [[integrated circuit]].

Discrete circuits include individual electronic components like resistors, capacitors, and diodes, as opposed to integrated circuits, or IC's, that include these components on a chip.  Proponents of discrete circuits argue that because discrete components are larger, they carry a higher voltage and are less susceptible to electrical interference.  Discrete circuits may also be desirable in developing application-specific designs for low-volume production, where it can occasionally be difficult to locate an appropriate off-the-shelf IC and the set-up cost of designing a new IC may be prohibitive.

Discrete circuits use individual resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and other devices to achieve the circuit function. These individual or discrete parts must be interconnected. The usual approach is to use a circuit board. This method, however, increases the cost of the circuit. The board, assembly, soldering, and testing all make up a part of the cost.

[[File:Sheath current filter.png|thumb|Sheath current filter for high-power lines]]

A '''sheath [[Current (electricity)|current]]''' is a form of charge transfer in wires. Sheath currents can run along the outer sheath of a [[coaxial cable]]. This can be caused by a geographically proximate or remote [[ground potential]]. 

Sheath currents may lower the efficiency of transmission and can interfere with nearby electronic devices. In addition, sheath currents caused by differences in ground potential at the ends of a coaxial cable to common mode signals that are superimposed on the useful signal as a noise voltage. Sheath currents can be caused by [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]].

==Countermeasures against sheath currents==

High-frequency signal lines may attenuate or prevent sheath currents using a sheath current filter which is applied to a coaxial cable in or near the device. In the simplest case, this is a [[ferrite bead]], it includes the coaxial inner and outer conductor and acts as a [[common-mode signal|common-mode]] [[Choke (electronics)|choke]]. At the same time, a ferrite bead has a transformer effect, so that a useful signal is confirmed as differential-mode. To increase the inductance compared to the unwanted common mode signal component, the cable can also be repeatedly passed through or wound around the bead.

In addition, higher frequency signals are often used with a capacitive coupling filter. More information is available in the article [[sheath current filter]]. 

With a [[balun]], sheath currents can be avoided when a balanced line is connected to an unbalanced line. Without the use of baluns, sheath currents will occur on the unbalanced line. A use for this is the combination of a symmetric [[dipole antenna]] with a coaxial line.

'''Capacitance''' is the ability of a body to store an electrical [[electric charge|charge]]. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits capacitance. A common form of energy storage device is a parallel-plate [[capacitor]]. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates. If the charges on the plates are +''q'' and −''q'', and ''V'' gives the [[voltage]] between the plates, then the capacitance ''C'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the voltage/current relationship
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = C \frac{\mathrm{d}V(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The capacitance is a function only of the physical dimensions (geometry) of the conductors and the [[permittivity]] of the [[dielectric]]. It is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.

The [[SI]] unit of capacitance is the [[farad]] (symbol: F), named after the English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 [[coulomb]] of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 [[volt]] between its plates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/farad&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, a farad was regarded as an inconveniently large unit, both electrically and physically. Its subdivisions were invariably used, namely the microfarad, nanofarad and picofarad.  More recently, technology has advanced such that capacitors of 1 farad and greater can be constructed in a structure little larger than a [[coin battery]] (so-called '[[Electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitors]]').  Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries.

The [[energy]] (measured in [[joule]]s) stored in a capacitor is equal to the ''work'' done to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance ''C'', holding a charge +''q'' on one plate and −''q'' on the other. Moving a small element of charge d''q'' from one plate to the other against the potential difference {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''q/C''}} requires the work d''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}W = \frac{q}{C}\,\mathrm{d}q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the work measured in joules, ''q'' is the charge measured in coulombs and ''C'' is the capacitance, measured in farads.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance ({{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 0}}) and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +''Q'' and −''Q'' requires the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = W_\text{stored}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Capacitors==
{{Main|Capacitor}}
The capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the [[farad]]. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the [[micro-|micro]]farad (µF), [[nano-|nano]]farad (nF), [[pico-|pico]]farad (pF), and, in microcircuits, [[femto-|femto]]farad (fF). However, specially made [[supercapacitors]] can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad.

Capacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. For example, the capacitance of a ''parallel-plate'' capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area ''A'' separated by a distance ''d'' is approximately equal to the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\ C=\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0\frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''C'' is the capacitance, in Farads;
:''A'' is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative static permittivity]] (sometimes called the dielectric constant) of the material between the plates (for a vacuum, {{nowrap|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}});
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]] (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=F m&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;}}); and
:''d'' is the separation between the plates, in meters;

Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.
The equation is a good approximation if ''d'' is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so the field in the capacitor over most of its area is uniform, and the so-called ''fringing field'' around the periphery provides a small contribution. In [[Gaussian units|CGS units]] the equation has the form:&lt;ref&gt;''The Physics Problem Solver'', 1986, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KVM2onr8_QYC&amp;pg=PA648 Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=\varepsilon_r\frac{A}{4\pi d}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' in this case has the units of length.
Combining the SI equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0} \frac{A}{d} V^2.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the energy, in joules; ''C'' is the capacitance, in farads; and ''V'' is the voltage, in volts.

===Voltage-dependent capacitors===
The dielectric constant for a number of very useful dielectrics changes as a function of the applied electrical field, for example [[ferroelectric]] materials, so the capacitance for these devices is more complex. For example, in charging such a capacitor the differential increase in voltage with charge is governed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ dQ=C(V) \, dV&lt;/math&gt;

where the voltage dependence of capacitance, ''C''(''V''), stems from the field, which in a large area parallel plate device is given by ''&lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; = V/d''. This field polarizes the dielectric, which polarization, in the case of a ferroelectric, is a nonlinear ''S''-shaped function of field, which, in the case of a large area parallel plate device, translates into a capacitance that is a nonlinear function of the voltage causing the field.&lt;ref name= Araujo&gt;{{Cite book|page=Figure 2, p. 504 |title=Science and Technology of Integrated Ferroelectrics: Selected Papers from Eleven Years of the Proceedings of the International Symposium on Integrated Ferroelectrics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QMlOkeJ4qN4C&amp;pg=PA504&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |isbn=90-5699-704-1 |author=Carlos Paz de Araujo, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, George W Taylor (Editors) |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Musikant&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Every Engineer Should Know about Ceramics |author=Solomon Musikant |isbn=0-8247-8498-7 |year=1991 |publisher=CRC Press |page=Figure 3.9, p. 43 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jc8xRdgdH38C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA43,M1 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to the voltage-dependent capacitance, to charge the capacitor to voltage ''V'' an integral relation is found:

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\int_0^VC(V) \, dV\ &lt;/math&gt;

which agrees with ''Q'' = ''CV'' only when ''C'' is voltage independent.

By the same token, the energy stored in the capacitor now is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dW =Q \, dV =\left[ \int_0^V\ dV' \ C(V') \right] \ dV \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating:

:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_0^V\ dV\ \int_0^V \ dV' \ C(V') = \int_0^V \ dV' \ \int_{V'}^V \ dV \ C(V') = \int_0^V\ dV' \left(V-V'\right) C(V') \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where interchange of the [[Order of integration (calculus)|order of integration]] is used.

The nonlinear capacitance of a microscope probe scanned along a ferroelectric surface is used to study the domain structure of ferroelectric materials.&lt;ref name=Cho&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scanning Nonlinear Dielectric Microscope |author=Yasuo Cho |edition=in ''Polar Oxides''; R Waser, U Böttger &amp; S Tiedke, editors |isbn=3-527-40532-1 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2005 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wQ09DhMBJroC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=nonlinear+capacitance+ferroelectric&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA303,M1 |page=Chapter 16 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of voltage dependent capacitance occurs in [[semiconductor devices]] such as semiconductor [[diode]]s, where the voltage dependence stems not from a change in dielectric constant but in a voltage dependence of the spacing between the charges on the two sides of the capacitor.&lt;ref name=Sze0&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physics of Semiconductor Devices |author=Simon M.

===Frequency-dependent capacitors===
If a capacitor is driven with a time-varying voltage that changes rapidly enough, then the polarization of the dielectric cannot follow the signal. As an example of the origin of this mechanism, the internal microscopic dipoles contributing to the dielectric constant cannot move instantly, and so as frequency of an applied alternating voltage increases, the dipole response is limited and the dielectric constant diminishes. A changing dielectric constant with frequency is referred to as [[dielectric dispersion]], and is governed by [[dielectric relaxation]] processes, such as [[Debye relaxation]]. Under transient conditions, the displacement field can be expressed as (see [[electric susceptibility]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{D(t)}=\varepsilon_0\int_{-\infty}^t \ \varepsilon_r (t-t') \boldsymbol E (t')\ dt' , &lt;/math&gt;

indicating the lag in response by the time dependence of ''ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', calculated in principle from an underlying microscopic analysis, for example, of the dipole behavior in the dielectric. See, for example, [[linear response function]].&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid |author=Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale |page=111 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&amp;pg=PA538&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA111,M1 |isbn=0-521-82112-6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rammer&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Field Theory of Non-equilibrium States |author=Jørgen Rammer |page=158 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A7TbrAm5Wq0C&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA158,M1 |isbn=0-521-87499-8 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time. A [[Fourier analysis#.28Continuous.29 Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] in time then results in:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol D(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega)\boldsymbol E (\omega)\ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(''ω'') is now a [[Complex function#Complex functions|complex function]], with an imaginary part related to absorption of energy from the field by the medium. See [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|permittivity]]. The capacitance, being proportional to the dielectric constant, also exhibits this frequency behavior. Fourier transforming Gauss's law with this form for displacement field:

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega) = j\omega Q(\omega) = j\omega \oint_{\Sigma} \boldsymbol D (\boldsymbol r , \ \omega)\cdot d \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=\left[ G(\omega) + j \omega C(\omega)\right] V(\omega) = \frac {V(\omega)}{Z(\omega)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''V''(''ω'') is the voltage component at angular frequency ''ω'', ''G''(''ω'') is the ''real'' part of the current, called the ''conductance'', and ''C''(''ω'') determines the ''imaginary'' part of the current and is the ''capacitance''. ''Z''(''ω'') is the complex impedance.

When a parallel-plate capacitor is filled with a dielectric, the measurement of dielectric properties of the medium is based upon the relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_r(\omega) = \varepsilon '_r(\omega) - j \varepsilon ''_r(\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega Z(\omega) C_0} = \frac{C_{\text{cmplx}}(\omega)}{C_0} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where a single ''prime'' denotes the real part and a double ''prime'' the imaginary part, ''Z''(''ω'') is the complex impedance with the dielectric present, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;cmplx&lt;/sub&gt;(''ω'') is the so-called ''complex'' capacitance with the dielectric present, and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the capacitance without the dielectric.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Cite book|title=Springer Handbook of Materials Measurement Methods |author=Horst Czichos, Tetsuya Saito, Leslie Smith |page=475 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8lANaR-Pqi4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA475&amp;dq=%22the+dielectric+permittivity+is+defined%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-20785-6 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coffey&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fractals, diffusion and relaxation in disordered complex systems..Part A |author=William Coffey, Yu.

Using this measurement method, the dielectric constant may exhibit a [[resonance]] at certain frequencies corresponding to characteristic response frequencies (excitation energies) of contributors to the dielectric constant.

==Capacitance matrix==

The discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape. The definition C=Q/V still holds for a single plate given a charge, in which case the field lines produced by that charge terminate as if the plate were at the center of an oppositely charged sphere at infinity.

&lt;math&gt;C = Q/V&lt;/math&gt; does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his ''coefficients of potential''. If three plates are given charges &lt;math&gt;Q_1, Q_2, Q_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage of plate 1 is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = P_{11}Q_1 + P_{12} Q_2 + P_{13}Q_3, &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the other voltages. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Sir William Thomson]] showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;P_{12}=P_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the ''elastance matrix'' or ''reciprocal capacitance matrix'', which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial Q_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, the mutual capacitance &lt;math&gt;C_{m}&lt;/math&gt; between two objects can be defined&lt;ref name=Jackson1999&gt;{{citation|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=Classical Electrodynamic|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1999|location=USA|edition=3rd.|pages=43|isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by solving for the total charge ''Q'' and using &lt;math&gt;C_{m}=Q/V&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;C_m = \frac{1}{(P_{11} + P_{22})-(P_{12} + P_{21})}&lt;/math&gt;

Since no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two &quot;plates&quot;, it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.

==Self-capacitance==
In electrical circuits, the term ''capacitance'' is usually a shorthand for the ''[[mutual capacitance]]'' between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor there also exists a property called ''self-capacitance'', which is the amount of electrical charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its [[electrical potential]] by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Greason|title=Electrostatic discharge in electronics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=404fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Research Studies Press|isbn=978-0-86380-136-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, centered on the conductor. Using this method, the self-capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius ''R'' is given by:&lt;ref name=NSW&gt;[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/COURSES/FIRST_YEAR/pdf%20files/5Capacitanceanddielectr.pdf Lecture notes]; University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=4\pi\varepsilon_0R \,&lt;/math&gt;

Example values of self-capacitance are:
*for the top &quot;plate&quot; of a [[van de Graaff generator]], typically a sphere 20&amp;nbsp;cm in radius: 22.24 pF
*the planet [[Earth]]: about 710 µF&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tipler | first = Paul | last2 = Mosca | first2 = Gene | title = Physics for scientists and engineers | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | page =752 | isbn =978-0-7167-0810-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inter-winding capacitance of a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]], which changes its [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at high frequencies and gives rise to parallel [[Electrical resonance|resonance]], is variously called self-capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Self-capacitance of inductors|doi=10.1109/63.602562 |author=Massarini, A.; Kazimierczuk, M.K.|year=1997|volume=12 |issue=4|pages= 671–676|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics}}: example of use of term self-capacitance&lt;/ref&gt; stray capacitance, or [[parasitic capacitance]].

==Elastance==
The reciprocal of capacitance is called ''elastance''. The unit of elastance is the [[daraf]], but is not recognised by SI.

==Stray capacitance==
{{Main|Parasitic capacitance}}
Any two adjacent conductors can be considered a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) effect is termed &quot;stray capacitance&quot;. Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at [[high frequency]].

Stray capacitance is often encountered in amplifier circuits in the form of [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]] capacitance that interconnects the input and output nodes (both defined relative to a common ground). It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/''K'', then an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of ''Z'' connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a ''Z''/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') impedance between the first node and ground and a ''KZ''/(''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, ''C'', is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''C''/''K'' from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.

==Capacitance of simple systems==
Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the [[Laplace equation]] ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0'' with a constant potential ''φ'' on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.

For quasi-two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]].

==Capacitance of nanoscale systems==
The capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as [[quantum dots]] may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.

===Single-electron devices===
The capacitance of a connected, or &quot;closed&quot;, single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or &quot;open&quot;, single-electron device.&lt;ref name= Tsu&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose &quot;direct polarization&quot; interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).&lt;ref name= LaFave-DCD&gt;

===Few-electron devices===
The derivation of a &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an ''N''-particle system given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = U(N) - U(N-1)&lt;/math&gt;

whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equation. The definition of capacitance,

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over C} \equiv {\Delta \,V\over\Delta \,Q}&lt;/math&gt;,

with the potential difference

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,V  = {\Delta \,\mu \,\over e} = {\mu(N+\Delta \,N) -\mu(N) \over e}&lt;/math&gt;

may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,N = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \,Q=e&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)} = {e^2 \over E(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of the device.&lt;ref&gt;

 |pages=15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This expression of &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where &lt;math&gt;W_\text{stored} = U&lt;/math&gt;, the stored electrostatic potential energy,

:&lt;math&gt;C = {Q^2\over 2U}&lt;/math&gt;

by a factor of 1/2 with &lt;math&gt;Q = Ne&lt;/math&gt;.

However, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of 1/2 is the result of integration in the conventional formulation,

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = U = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q&lt;/math&gt;

which is appropriate since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q \to \Delta \,Q= e&lt;/math&gt;. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance and electrostatic interaction energy,

:&lt;math&gt;Q=CV&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U=QV&lt;/math&gt;,

respectively, to obtain,

:&lt;math&gt;C = {Q\over V} = Q {Q \over U} = {Q^2 \over U}&lt;/math&gt;

which is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of the spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an ''average'' electrostatic potential experiences by ''each'' electron is utilized in the derivation.

The reason for the apparent mathematical differences is understood more fundamentally as the energy, &lt;math&gt;U(N)&lt;/math&gt;, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a &quot;connected&quot; device in the lower limit ''N''=1. As ''N'' grows large, &lt;math&gt;U(N)\to U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LaFave-DCD/&gt; Thus, the general expression of capacitance is

:&lt;math&gt;C(N) = {(Ne)^2 \over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the &quot;capacitor&quot; is often an isolated, or partially isolated, component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carrier, or electrons that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, [[nanowires]] consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15710">[[Image:photon-noise.jpg|thumb|300px|Photon noise simulation.]]
'''Shot noise''' is a type of [[electronic noise]] which originates from the [[Elementary charge|discrete nature]] of electric charge. The term also applies to photon counting in optical devices, where shot noise is associated with the [[Wave–particle duality|particle nature]] of light.

==Origin==

It is known that in a [[Probability theory|statistical experiment]] such as tossing a fair coin and counting the occurrences of heads and tails, the numbers of heads and tails after a great many throws will differ by only a tiny percentage, while after only a few throws outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot. (It can be proven that the relative fluctuations reduce as the square root of the number of throws, a result valid for all statistical fluctuations, including shot noise.)

Shot noise exists because phenomena such as light and electric current consist of the movement of discrete (also called &quot;quantized&quot;) 'packets'.  Consider light&amp;mdash;a stream of discrete photons&amp;mdash;coming out of a laser pointer and hitting a wall to create a visible spot. The fundamental physical processes that govern light emission are such that these photons are emitted from the laser at random times; but the many billions of photons needed to create a spot are so many that the brightness, the number of photons per unit time, varies only infinitesimally with time. However, if the laser brightness is reduced until only a handful of photons hit the wall every second, the relative fluctuations in number of photons, i.e., brightness, will be significant, just as when tossing a coin a few times. These fluctuations are shot noise.

The concept of shot noise was first introduced in 1918 by [[Walter Schottky]] who studied fluctuations of current in [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schottky|first=W.|year=1918|title=Über spontane Stromschwankungen in verschiedenen Elektrizitätsleitern|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume=57|pages=541–567|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot noise may be dominant when the finite number of particles that carry energy (such as [[electron]]s in an electronic circuit or [[photon]]s in an optical device) is sufficiently small so that uncertainties due to the [[Poisson distribution]], which describes the occurrence of independent random events, are of significance. It is important in [[electronics]], [[telecommunications]], [[optical detector|optical detection]], and fundamental [[physics]].

The term can also be used to describe any noise source, even if solely mathematical, of similar origin. For instance, particle simulations may produce a certain amount of &quot;noise&quot;, where due to the small number of particles simulated, the simulation exhibits undue statistical fluctuations which don't reflect the real-world system. The magnitude of shot noise increases according to the square root of the expected number of events, such as the electrical current or intensity of light. But since the strength of the signal itself increases more rapidly, the ''relative'' proportion of shot noise decreases and the [[signal to noise ratio]] (considering only shot noise) increases anyway. Thus shot noise is more frequently observed with small currents or light intensities following sufficient amplification.

[[File:Poisson pmf.svg|thumb|The number of photons that are collected by a given detector varies, and follows a [[Poisson distribution]], depicted here for averages of 1, 4, and 10.]]
For large numbers the Poisson distribution approaches a [[normal distribution]], typically making shot noise in actual observations indistinguishable from true [[Gaussian noise]] except when the elementary events (photons, electrons, etc.) are so few that they are individually observed. Since the [[standard deviation]] of shot noise is equal to the square root of the average number of events ''N'', the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{N}{\sqrt{N}} = \sqrt{N}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus when ''N'' is very large, the signal-to-noise ratio is very large as well, and any ''relative'' fluctuations in ''N'' due to other sources are more likely to dominate over shot noise. However when the other noise source is at a fixed level, such as thermal noise, increasing ''N'' (the DC current or light level, etc.) can sometimes lead to dominance of shot noise nonetheless.

==Properties==
===Electronic devices===
Shot noise in electronic circuits consists of random fluctuations of the [[electric current]] in a [[direct current|DC]] current which originate due to fact that current actually consists of a flow of discrete charges ([[electron]]s). Because the electron has such a tiny charge, however, shot noise is of relative insignificance in many (but not all) cases of electrical conduction. For instance 1 [[ampere]] of current consists of about {{val|6.24|e=18}} electrons per second; even though this number will randomly vary by several billion in any given second, such a fluctuation is minuscule compared to the current itself. In addition, shot noise is often less significant as compared with two other noise sources in electronic circuits, [[flicker noise]] and [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]. However, shot noise is temperature and frequency independent, in contrast to Johnson–Nyquist noise, which is proportional to temperature, and flicker noise, with the spectral density decreasing with the frequency. Therefore at high frequencies and low temperatures shot noise may become the dominant source of noise.

With very small currents and considering shorter time scales (thus wider bandwidths) shot noise can be significant. For instance, a microwave circuit operates on time scales of less than a [[nanosecond]] and if we were to have a current of 16 [[nanoampere]]s that would amount to only 100 electrons passing every nanosecond. According to [[Poisson statistics]] the ''actual'' number of electrons in any nanosecond would vary by 10 electrons [[root mean square|rms]], so that one sixth of the time less than 90 electrons would pass a point and one sixth of the time more than 110 electrons would be counted in a nanosecond. Now with this small current viewed on this time scale, the shot noise amounts to 1/10 of the DC current itself.

The result by Schottky, based on the assumption that the statistics of electrons passage is Poissonian, reads&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanter|first=Ya. M.|coauthors=Büttiker, M.|year=2000|title=Shot noise in mesoscopic conductors|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=Dordrecht|volume=336|issue=1-2|pages=1–166|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(99)00123-4|arxiv = cond-mat/9910158 |bibcode = 2000PhR...336....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the spectral noise density at the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
S (\omega) = 2e\vert I \vert \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron charge, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the average current created by the electron stream. The noise spectral power is frequency independent, which means the noise is [[White noise|white]]. This is the [[Classical physics|classical]] result in the sense that it does not take into account that electrons obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. This can be combined with the [[Landauer formula]], which relates the average current with the [[transmission eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; of the contact through which the current is measured (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; labels [[transport channel]]s). In the simplest case these transmission eigenvalues can be taken energy independent, the Landauer formula is 
:&lt;math&gt;
I = \frac{e^2}{\pi\hbar} V \sum_n T_n \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the applied voltage. This provides for 
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{2e^3}{\pi\hbar} \vert V \vert \sum_n T_n \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
commonly referred to as the Poisson value of shot noise, &lt;math&gt;S_P&lt;/math&gt;. The correct result takes into account the quantum statistics of electrons and reads (at zero temperature)
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{2e^3}{\pi\hbar} \vert V \vert \sum_n T_n (1 - T_n)\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
It was obtained in the 1990s by [[Viktor Khlus (physicist)|Khlus]], [[Gordey Lesovik|Lesovik]] (independently the single-channel case), and [[Markus Büttiker|Büttiker]] (multi-channel case).&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;/&gt; This noise is white and is always suppressed with respect to the Poisson value. The degree of suppression, &lt;math&gt;F = S/S_P&lt;/math&gt;, is known as the [[Fano factor]]. Noises produced by different transport channels are independent. Fully open (&lt;math&gt;T_n=1&lt;/math&gt;) and fully closed (&lt;math&gt;T_n=0&lt;/math&gt;) channels produce no noise, since there are no irregularities in the electron stream.

At finite temperature, a closed expression for noise can be written.&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;/&gt; It interpolates between shot noise (zero temperature) and Nyquist-Johnson noise (high temperature).

====Examples====
* '''[[Tunnel junction]]''' is characterized by low transmission in all transport channels, therefore the electron flow is Poissonian, and the Fano factor equals one.
* '''[[Quantum point contact]]''' is characterized by an ideal transmission in all open channels, therefore it does not produce any noise, and the Fano factor equals zero. The exception is the step between plateaus, when one of the channels is partially open and produces noise.
* A metallic diffusive wire has the Fano factor equals 1/3 independently on the geometry and the details of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beenakker|first=C.W.J.|coauthors=Büttiker, M.|year=1992|title=Suppression of shot noise in metallic diffusive conductors|journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=46|pages=1889–1892|url=http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v46/i3/p1889_1|bibcode = 1992PhRvB..46.1889B |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.46.1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of interactions====
While this is the result when the electrons contributing to the current occur completely randomly, unaffected by each other, there are important cases in which these natural fluctuations are largely suppressed due to a charge build up. Take the previous example in which an average of 100 electrons go from point A to point B every nanosecond. During the first half of a nanosecond we would expect 50 electrons to arrive at point B on the average, but in a particular half nanosecond there might well be 60 electrons which arrive there. This will create a more negative electric charge at point B than average, and that extra charge will tend to ''repel'' the further flow of electrons from leaving point A during the remaining half nanosecond. Thus the net current integrated over a nanosecond will tend more to stay near its average value of 100 electrons rather than exhibiting the expected fluctuations (10 electrons rms) we calculated. This is the case in ordinary metallic wires and in metal film [[resistors]], where shot noise is almost completely cancelled due to this anti-correlation between the motion of individual electrons, acting on each other through the [[coulomb force]]. 

However this reduction in shot noise does not apply when the current results from random events at a potential barrier which all the electrons must overcome due to a random excitation, such as by thermal activation. This is the situation in [[p-n junction]]s, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Paul and Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics, 2nd edition. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 431–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/Anniversary/8.html Bryant, James, Analog Dialog, issue 24-3]&lt;/ref&gt; A semiconductor [[diode]] is thus commonly used as a noise source by passing a particular DC current through it.

Shot noise is distinct from voltage and current fluctuations expected in thermal equilibrium; this occurs without any applied DC voltage or current flowing. These fluctuations are known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]] or thermal noise and increase in proportion to the [[Kelvin]] temperature of any resistive component. However both are instances of [[white noise]] and thus cannot be distinguished simply by observing them even though their origins are quite dissimilar.

Since shot noise is a [[Poisson process]] due to the finite charge of an electron, one can compute the [[root mean square]] current fluctuations as being of a magnitude

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_i=\sqrt{2\,q\,I\,\Delta f}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is the [[elementary charge]] of an electron,  Δ''f'' is the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in [[hertz]] over which the noise is considered, and ''I'' is the DC current flowing.

For a current of 100 mA, measuring the current noise over a bandwidth of 1 Hz, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_i = 0.18\,\mathrm{nA}  \; .
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Comment:  previous version had incorrect units for \sigma. Should be Amperes, not Amperes / sqrt(Hz). --&gt;

If this noise current is fed through a resistor a noise voltage of
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_v = \sigma_i \, R
&lt;/math&gt;
would be generated. Coupling this noise through a capacitor, one could supply a noise power of
:&lt;math&gt;
P = {\frac 1 2}\,q\,I\,\Delta f R.
&lt;/math&gt;
to a matched load.

===Optics ===
In [[optics]], shot noise describes the fluctuations of the number of photons detected (or simply counted in the abstract) due to their occurrence independent of each other. This is therefore another consequence of discretization, in this case of the energy in the electromagnetic field in terms of photons. In the case of photon ''detection'', the relevant process is the random conversion of photons into photo-electrons for instance, thus leading to a larger effective shot noise level when using a detector with a [[quantum efficiency]] below unity. Only in an exotic [[squeezed coherent state]] can the number of photons measured per unit time have fluctuations smaller than the square root of the expected number of photons counted in that period of time. Of course there are other mechanisms of noise in optical signals which often dwarf the contribution of shot noise. When these are absent, however, optical detection is said to be &quot;photon noise limited&quot; as only the shot noise (also known as &quot;quantum noise&quot; or &quot;photon noise&quot; in this context) remains.

Shot noise is easily observable in the case of  [[photomultiplier]]s and [[Avalanche photodiodes]] used in the Geiger mode, where individual photon detections are observed. However the same noise source is present with higher light intensities measured by any [[photo detector]], and is directly measurable when it dominates the noise of the subsequent electronic amplifier. Just as with other forms of shot noise, the fluctuations in a photo-current due to shot noise scale as the square-root of the average intensity: 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta I^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \langle\left(I-\langle I\rangle
\right)^2\rangle \propto I. &lt;/math&gt;

The shot noise of a coherent optical beam (having no other noise sources) is a fundamental physical phenomenon, reflecting [[quantum fluctuation]]s in the electromagnetic field (due to the so-called [[zero-point energy]]). This sets a lower bound on the noise introduced by [[quantum amplifier]]s which preserve the phase of an optical signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8670">The operation of most digital circuit systems, such as computer systems, is synchronized by a &quot;clock&quot; that dictates the sequence and pacing of the devices on the circuit.  Ideally, the input to each element has reached its final value before the next clock movement occurs so that the behavior of the whole circuit can be predicted exactly. The maximum speed at which a system can run must account for the variance that occurs between the various elements of a circuit due to differences in physical composition, temperature, and path length.

In a [[synchronous circuit]], clock skew (T&lt;sub&gt;Skew&lt;/sub&gt;) is the difference in the arrival time between ''two sequentially-adjacent registers''. Given two sequentially-adjacent registers R&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with clock arrival times at register clock pins as T&lt;sub&gt;C''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;C''j''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, then clock skew can be defined as: {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;Skew ''i, j''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} T&lt;sub&gt;C''i''&lt;/sub&gt; - T&lt;sub&gt;C''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}

Clock skew can be positive or negative. If the clock signals are in complete synchronicity, then the clock skew observed at these registers is zero.

==In circuit design==
In circuit designs, '''clock skew''' (sometimes '''timing skew''') is a phenomenon in [[synchronous circuit]]s in which the clock signal (sent from the [[clock circuit]]) arrives at different components at different times. This can be caused by many different things, such as wire-interconnect length, temperature variations, variation in intermediate devices, [[capacitive coupling]], material imperfections, and differences in input capacitance on the clock inputs of devices using the clock. As the clock rate of a circuit increases, timing becomes more critical and less variation can be tolerated if the circuit is to function properly.

There are two types of clock skew: '''negative skew''' and '''positive skew'''. Positive skew occurs when the transmitting register receives the clock earlier than the receiving register. Negative skew is the opposite: the receiving register gets the clock earlier than the sending register.

===Harmful skew===

Two types of violation can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock travels slower than the path from one register to another - allowing data to penetrate two registers in the same clock tick, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a '''hold violation''' because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a '''setup violation''' occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).

===Beneficial skew===
Clock skew can also benefit a circuit by increasing the clock period locally at which the circuit will operate correctly. For each source register and destination register connected by a path, the following inequalities must hold:
# &lt;math&gt; T \ge reg + path_{max} + S - (s_d - s_s) &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; (s_d - s_s) \le reg + path_{min} - H &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''T'' is the clock period,
*''reg'' is the source register's clock to Q delay,
*&lt;math&gt;path_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the path with the longest delay from source to destination,
*''S'' is the [[setup time]] of the destination register
*&lt;math&gt;(s_d - s_s)&lt;/math&gt; represents the clock skew from the source to the destination registers,
*&lt;math&gt;path_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the path with the shortest delay from source to destination,
*''H'' is the hold time of the destination register,
*&lt;math&gt;s_d&lt;/math&gt; is the clock skew to the destination register, and
*&lt;math&gt;s_s&lt;/math&gt; is the clock skew to the source register.

Positive clock skews are good for fixing setup violations, but can cause hold violations.

===Optimal skew===
If the clock arrival times at individual registers are viewed as variables to be adjusted in order to minimize the clock period while satisfying the above inequalities for every path through the circuit, then the result is a [[Linear Programming]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;Fishburn, J.P. “Clock Skew Optimization”, in ''IEEE Trans. On Computers'', Vol. 39, No. 7, July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this linear program, zero clock skew is merely a feasible point - the solution to the linear program generally gives a clock period that is less than what is achieved by zero skew.  In addition, safety margins greater than or equal to the zero skew case can be guaranteed by setting setup and hold times appropriately in the linear program.

Due to the simple form of this linear program, an easily programmed algorithm is available for arriving at a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Maheshwari, N., and Sapatnekar, S.S., ''Timing Analysis and Optimization of Sequential Circuits'', Kluwer, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CAD systems for VLSI and FPGA design contain facilities for optimizing clock skews.

=== Confusion between clock skew and clock jitter ===

In addition to clock skew due to static differences in  the clock latency from the clock source to each clocked register, no clock signal is perfectly periodic, so that the clock period or clock cycle time varies even at a single component, and this variation is known as clock [[Jitter]].  At a particular point in a clock distribution network, jitter is the only contributor to the clock timing uncertainty.  

As an approximation, it is often useful to discuss the total clock timing uncertainty between two registers as the sum of spatial clock skew (the spatial differences in clock latency from the clock source), and clock jitter (meaning the non-periodicity of the clock at a particular point in the network).  Unfortunately, spatial clock skew varies in time from one cycle to the next due to local time-dependent variations in the power supply, local temperature, and noise coupling to other signals.  

Thus, in the usual case of sending and receiving registers at different locations, there is no clear way to separate the total clock timing uncertainty into spatial skew and jitter.  Thus some authors use the term clock skew to describe the sum of spatial clock skew and clock jitter.  This of course means that the clock skew between two points varies from cycle to cycle, which is a complexity that is rarely mentioned.  Many other authors use the term clock skew only for the spatial variation of clock times, and use the term clock jitter to represent the rest of the total clock timing uncertainty.  This of course means that the clock jitter must be different at each component, which again is rarely discussed.  

Fortunately, in many cases, spatial clock skew remains fairly constant from cycle to cycle, so that the rest of the total clock timing uncertainty can be well approximated by a single common clock jitter value.  

The Optimal Skew discussion above, for example refers only to the static component of the spatial clock skew.

==On a network==

On a network such as the internet, '''clock skew''' describes the difference in time shown by the clocks at the different nodes on the network. It is usually an unavoidable phenomenon (at least if one looks at milli-second resolutions), but clock skew of tens of minutes or more is also quite common. Network operations that require time stamps which are comparable across hosts can be affected by clock skew. A number of protocols (e.g. [[Network Time Protocol]]) have been designed to reduce clock skew, and produce more stable functions. Some applications (such as game servers) may also use their own synchronization mechanism to avoid reliability problems due to clock skew.

== Interfaces==
Clock skew is the reason why at fast speeds or long distances, serial interfaces (e.g. [[Serial Attached SCSI]] or [[USB]]) are preferred over parallel interfaces (e.g. parallel [[SCSI]]).

'''Bandwidth allocation''' is the process of assigning [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] to different applications.  The radio spectrum is a finite resource creating the need for an effective allocation process. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission or [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] has the responsibility allocating the portions of the spectrum, or bands, to various industries. For example, the FCC shifted the location of television on the spectrum, to open up more space for mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_53/b4065000572464.htm?chan=ma &quot;Just Ahead: A Wider Wireless World&quot;],&quot;Wildstrom, S.&quot;,BusinessWeek,December 19, 2007,Retrieved February 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Different bands of spectrum are able to transmit more data than others, and some bands of the spectrum transmit clearer than others.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile and Wireless Communications,&quot;Gow G.&amp; Smith R.&quot;,Open University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;   These bands are of critical importance for companies that intend to operate a business involving wireless communications.

==FCC methods==

===Auctions===
One method used to assign bands to users is auctions, since FCC found this method to be the most profitable as they earned millions of dollars through auctions. Some economists believe based on [[Auction Theory|auction theory]], auctions are the most efficient method of allocating resources. Due to the differences in the amount of data each band can transmit and the clarity of the signal, auctions allow the more desirable bands to sell for more.&lt;ref&gt;Putting Economics above Ideology,&quot;Hazlett, T&quot;,Barrons, July 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The United States currently auctions off bands that then become the property of purchaser. The FCC spectrum auctions have multiple rounds of bidding, as opposed to each party submitting one sealed bid.  The FCC, when auctioning multiple bands, auctions them simultaneously. This allows for a more efficient bidding process, and keeps bands being auctioned at the end of the auction from being over or under valued.  An example of this practice was the [[United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction|700 MHz auction]] in 2008.  A benefit of this method is that the government is able to raise money.  A potential problem of this method is that smaller companies may be priced out of the market and unable to compete with large firms. This would reduce the number of points of view in the communications industry, which would violate one of the principles of the FCC, to protect the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=Peter|title=Efficiency of the FCC Spectrum Auction|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date=October 1998|volume=41|pages=727–736|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/7068/1/efficiency-of-the-fcc-spectrum-auctions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Moradikordalivand and T. A. Rahman, &quot;Broadband modified rectangular microstrip patch antenna using stepped cut at four corners method,&quot; Progress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 137, 599-619, 2013 http://www.jpier.org/pier/pier.php?paper=13011714&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotteries===
Another method used to allocate bands of frequencies was lotteries. Lotteries were used by the FCC in the 1980s. A benefit of lotteries was that it gave all parties a chance at winning, unlike auctions which favor parties with more money. By giving all parties a chance it was believed that it served the public interest better. Some disadvantages of the lottery method was that some firm would engage in [[rent-seeking]] behavior, and try to get multiple licenses that they did not intend to use, but only intend to sell to another firm.  In this situation not only were firms using rent-seeking behavior on a public resource, but the negotiations between firms could go on for years, meaning that frequencies were not being used and the public interest was not being served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmon|first=Timothy|title=Auctioning Public Assets: Analysis and Alternatives|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-83059-1|url=http://mailer.fsu.edu/~tsalmon/FCCchapter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative hearings===
A third method used to allocate bands is the administrative process, also called comparative hearings. This method was used primarily before 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Spectrum Auction Data|url=http://capcp.psu.edu/FCC/|work=FCC Spectrum Auction Data|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this method all interested firms would make a presentation about why they should receive the license for that band of frequencies.  Some advantages of this method are that they are flexible, meaning that FCC can use different criteria for different bands. This would allow the FCC to ensure that the public interest was acknowledged.  There are also disadvantages to this method. A primary disadvantage is that the government does not raise revenue from hearing, as they would under other methods such as auctions. Along with the flexibility that the method allows for, it also can cause a lack of transparency because the criteria the decision is based on can differ from case to case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMillan|first=John|title=Why Auction the Spectrum?|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/mcmillan/personal_page/documents/Why%20Auction%20the%20Spectrum%201.pdf|work=Why Auction the Spectrum|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage is that the hearings process can be take a long time to come to a conclusion.

The FCC is also responsible for reallocating bands of frequencies to different allocations. As new technologies develop the demand for frequency bands changes and makes some bands more desirable than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving Toward a Market for Spectrum|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv16n2/reg16n2e.html|work=Moving Toward a Market for Spectrum|publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When this occurs, the FCC may make a decision to move an application to a different band of spectrum to make room for something else.  In this case the FCC gives the existing application several years to prepare for the transition.  An example of this transition when the FCC reallocated the 700mhz band from broadcast television to mobile phone applications. The FCC first voted to reallocate the band in 2002, however the broadcast television firms were not required to stop broadcasting until February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malik|first=Om|title=700 MHz Explained in 10 Steps|url=http://gigaom.com/2007/03/14/700mhz-explained/|work=700 MHz Explained in 10 Steps|publisher=GIGA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bandwidth limitations==
The exponential increase in mobile data traffic during the decades of 1990's and 2000's has led to the massive deployment of wireless systems. 
As a consequence, the limited available RF spectrum is subject to an aggressive spatial reuse and co-channel interference has become a major capacity limiting factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsonev&quot;&gt;&quot;Light Fidelity (Li-Fi): Towards All-Optical Networking&quot;, D. Tsonev, S. Videv and H. Haas; Institute for Digital Communications, Li-Fi R&amp;D Centre, The University of Edinburgh, EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, there have been many independent warnings
of a looming &quot;RF spectrum crisis&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFcrisis&quot;&gt;Ofcom, “[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/cfi-mobile-bb/annexes/RW_report.pdf Study on the future UK spectrum demand for terrestrial mobile broadband applications]” report, realwireless (June 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
as the mobile data demands continue to increase while the network spectral efficiency saturates despite newly-introduced standards and great technological advancements in the field.

It is estimated that by 2017, more than 11 exabytes of data traffic will have to be transferred through mobile networks
every month.,.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsonev&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cisco1&quot;&gt;“Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2012-2017”,Cisco Visual Networking Index; White Paper, CISCO (Feb. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data crunch===
The radio frequency spectrum is a limited natural resource which is increasingly in demand from a large and growing number of services such as fixed, mobile, broadcasting, amateur, space research, emergency telecommunications, meteorology, global positioning systems, environmental monitoring and communication services – that ensure safety of life on land, at sea and in the skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rancy|first=Francois|title=Welcome to ITU-R|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&amp;rlink=itur-welcome&amp;lang=en|publisher=ITU|accessdate=April 27, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110514111147/http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&amp;rlink=itur-welcome&amp;lang=en| archivedate= May 14, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Un-coordinated use can lead to malfunctioning of telecommunication services. ITU-R plays a key to ensure radio communications. In its capacity as the unique global radio spectrum manager, ITU-R identifies and harmonizes spectrum for use by wireless broadband systems, ensuring that these valuable frequencies are used efficiently and without interference from other radio systems. Allocates spectrum for communications (including mobile and broadcasting), satellite communications, and spectrum for advanced aeronautical communications, global maritime issues, protect frequencies for Earth-exploration satellites to monitor resources, emergencies, meteorology and climate change. Telecom services are converging and actors in the ICT world must adapt to all- IP (all data) networks. Data usage over wireless networks is rapidly increasing as more consumers surf the web, check email, and watch video on mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gahran|first=Amy|title=FCC warns of looming mobile spectrum crunch|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-11-05/tech/gahran.mobile.spectrum.crunch_1_spectrum-policies-mobile-broadband-spectrum-crunch?_s=PM:TECH|publisher=CNN Tech|accessdate=April 29, 2011|date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, according to Cisco, the surging growth in global mobile data traffic is projected to rise by sixty-six times by 2013, with video accounting for the lion’s share of this increase in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhao|first=Houlin|title=Globalizing Trend of China’s Mobile Internet|url=http://www.itu.int/en/osg/speechesdsg/Presentation%20Globalizing%20Trend%20China%20Mobile%20Internet.ppt|publisher=ITU|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The evolution in data traffic foresees a future “data crunch”. In wireless services, this “data crunch” is putting further pressure on a more efficient use of spectrum. In the United States, according to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, &quot;The explosive growth in mobile communications is outpacing our ability to keep up. If no proactive course is taken to update spectrum policies for the 21st century, limits will be reached. Some countries are already adapting to the impending crisis by investing in broadband and reassigning spectrum bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Budde|first=Paul|title=Broadband: A Platform For Progress|url=http://www.itu.int/bbcommission/report2.pdf|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ITU is raising awareness to promote investment in broadband and keeps working to improve spectrum management worldwide. However, the argument about a looming bandwidth crunch is refutable according to some points of view. Former FCC official Uzoma Onyeije conducted a study that questions the existence of a broadband spectrum crisis, and further goes on to suggest alternatives to existing networks that would mitigate the need to reallocate spectrum. Onyeije argues that before claiming a “Spectrum Crisis” exists, carriers should leverage available marketplace solutions to appease the current infrastructure namely upgrading network technology, adopting fair use policies, migrating voice to internet protocol, leveraging consumer infrastructure, enhancing carrier Infrastructure, packet prioritization, caching, channel bonding and encouraging the development of bandwidth-sensitive applications and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onyeije|first=Uzoma|title=SOLVING THE CAPACITY CRUNCH Options for Enhancing Data Capacity on Wireless Networks Onyeije|url=http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/pdfs/042511_Solving_the_Capacity_Crunch.pdf|publisher=Onyeije Consulting LLC|accessdate=April 30, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110521191802/http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/pdfs/042511_Solving_the_Capacity_Crunch.pdf| archivedate= May 21, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, the [[User-in-the-loop]] paradigm mitigates the data crunch by shaping the demand side by involving all the users, which makes expensive over-provisioning obsolete.

Bandwidth allocation can also be used in reference to the [[computing]] industry, in scenarios such as allocating [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to a [[web site]] running on a [[server (computing)|server]], or allocating bandwidth to a computer on a [[Computer networking|network]]. Allocations in [[computing]] are often administered/enforced by terminating or temporarily suspending access once the allocated bandwidth has been utilized. Setting it to high increases download speed and the connectivity of other devices on the network.

==Control of bandwidth allocation abroad==
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government that is responsible for allocating portions of the wireless spectrum for broadband, public safety, and the media.

===Egypt===
Unlike the government of the U.S, the government of Egypt does not have their own communications infrastructure, but private companies operate their own communication infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblogs.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt may have turned off the Internet one phone call at a time|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/01/egypts-internet-blackout-unprecedented.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-government controlled allocation of communications became the unprecedented issue of discussion during the Egyptian social protests on January 25, 2011. The Egyptian government shut down all forms communications, including the internet and all on-line services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Bobbie|title=How Egypt Switched Off the Internet|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/01/28/how-egypt-switched-off-the-internet/|accessdate=January 28, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110128170937/http://gigaom.com/2011/01/28/how-egypt-switched-off-the-internet/| archivedate= January 28, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the Egyptian government blocked the internet data usage for smart phones and black-berrys, and social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as well. They also eventually cut off mobile phone service.  This was possible even though the Egyptian government does not control communications because there are no agencies mandated to control communications.  The fact is, the cooperation of the Internet service providers with the Egyptian government was necessary because they would otherwise have difficulties ethically running their business. If the government calls up the company service provider and makes a request within legal rights, then they give into the government’s demands even if they are illegal according to the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblogs.latimes.com&quot;/&gt; They have to follow the government’s requests, in order to conduct business in that country.

===China===
The [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP)of China blocked certain websites without any explanations or warnings. The first blockage of sites occurred from June 2, 2004 to June 21, 2004; they blocked access to Chinese Wikipedia Web Sites in Beijing.  The second occurrence of internet blocks in China happened from September 23, 2004 to September 27, 2004. Some people could not access Wikipedia for a few days, and even if they gained access they could not access all pages. The third incidence of wiki-block in China started on October 19, 2005. The ISP lifted the blockage partially on October 10, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Lifts Wikipedia Blockage|url=http://www.waleg.com/archives/005813.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061123180038/http://www.waleg.com/archives/005813.html| archivedate= November 23, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they blocked it again November 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia Unblocked?|url=http://www.chinese-forums.com/index.php?/topic/10436-wikipedia-unblocked/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They blocked Wikipedia in all languages again on August 31, 2007, but lifted this blockage April 2, 2008. Most recently, Wikipedia was blocked altogether in China starting April 6, 2008. It is possible to access the website by logging in through https, but sensitive issues such as the conflict with Tibet are still blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China allows access to English Wikipedia|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/04/05/idINIndia-32865420080405|accessdate=April 5, 2008 | work=Reuters|date=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two cases in two separate countries show how important the role of the communications infrastructure and allocating bandwidth is, and how easy it is to switch off the access, especially in countries that have the power to control communications.

==NTIA spectrum management &amp; policy==

===Office of Spectrum Management (OSM)===
The Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) is solely responsible for managing the U.S. Federal Government’s usage of the radio frequency spectrum. OSM manages and works together with the sub-office, Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) to execute various operations for Federal Government use. 
OSM and the IRAC collaborate to establish and issue policy regarding allocations and regulations governing the Federal Government’s spectrum usage; develop plans for the peacetime and wartime use of the spectrum; prepare for, participate in, and implementing the results of international radio conferences; assigning frequencies; assigning of government specific frequencies; and maintaining Federal agencies new telecommunications systems and certifying that spectrum will be available. Additionally, the OSM together with the IRAC provides the technical engineering expertise needed to perform specific spectrum resources assessment and automated computer capabilities needed to carry out these investigations; participate in all aspects of the Federal Government’s communications related emergency readiness activities; and participate in Federal Government telecommunication automated information systems security activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Spectrum Management|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/osmhome.html|publisher=NTIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Federal Government spectrum management – Spectrum policy for 21st century===
The 21st century has presented a society of wireless communications that has become a key element for a free society of information. Due to a modern need for fast and reliable information and communication the United States Federal Government has implemented the insurance of national and homeland defense, available public safety, first-responder services, and jobs revolving around research and service provision under the United States national radio communications services.

The United States and the President has additionally and personally established the position for spectrum management policies for Federal and non-Federal usage. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) continues annual regulation of spectrum bandwidth, specifically Federal usage. Additionally, an Executive Memorandum, issued directly from the President states a direct policy for continued improvements on spectrum management within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spectrum Policy Initiative for the 21st century|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/spectrumreform/|publisher=NTIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectrum Policy Task Force===
Established in June 2002, the Spectrum Policy Task Force was created to help assist the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in understanding the constant changing forces upon spectrum policy. The Spectrum Policy Task Force ultimately maximizes the public access, usage and benefits that derive from the radio spectrum.

Exact tasks of the Spectrum Task Force include the provision of specific information and recommendations to the FCC for evolving methods to the current “command and control” (C&amp;C) approach to spectrum policy. The Spectrum Task Force also specializes in assisting the FCC in addressing spectrum issues such as: technical device/signal interference, spectrum efficiency, and effective public safety communications for domestic and international spectrum policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Spectrum Policy Task Force|url=http://www.fcc.gov/sptf/|publisher=FCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16262">A '''heterojunction''' is the interface that occurs between two [[Layer (electronics)|layer]]s or regions of dissimilar [[crystalline]] [[semiconductor]]s. These semiconducting materials have unequal [[band gap]]s as opposed to a [[homojunction]]. It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid state device applications including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors (&quot;'''heterotransistors'''&quot;) to name a few. The combination of multiple heterojunctions together in a device is called a '''heterostructure''' although the two terms are commonly used interchangeably. The requirement that each material be a semiconductor with unequal band gaps is somewhat loose especially on small length scales where electronic properties depend on spatial properties. A more modern definition of heterojunction is the interface between any two solid-state materials, including crystalline and amorphous structures of metallic, insulating, [[fast ion conductor]] and semiconducting materials.

In 2000, the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics was awarded jointly to [[Herbert Kroemer]] ([[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], USA) and [[Zhores I. Alferov]] ([[Ioffe Institute]], [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia) for &quot;developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and opto-electronics&quot;

== Manufacture and applications ==

Heterojunction manufacturing generally requires the use of [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C.G (1996). &quot;Low-dimensional quantum devices&quot;. Rep. Prog. Phys. 59 (1996) 235282,pg 244.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) technologies in order to precisely control the deposition thickness and create a cleanly lattice-matched abrupt interface. MBE and CVD tend to be very complex and expensive compared to traditional [[silicon]] [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|device fabrication]].{{fact|date=May 2012}}

Despite their expense, heterojunctions have found use in a variety of specialized applications where their unique characteristics are critical:
* ''Lasers'': Using heterojunctions in [[laser]]s was first proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1963.2706|title=A proposed class of hetero-junction injection lasers|year=1963|last1=Kroemer|first1=H.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=51|issue=12|pages=1782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 when [[Herbert Kroemer]], a prominent scientist in this field, suggested that [[population inversion]] could be greatly enhanced by heterostructures. By incorporating a smaller [[direct band gap]] material like [[GaAs]] between two larger band gap layers like [[AlAs]], [[charge carriers in semiconductors|carriers]] can be confined so that [[lasing]] can occur at [[room temperature]] with low threshold currents. It took many years for the [[material science]] of heterostructure fabrication to catch up with Kroemer's ideas but now it is the industry standard. It was later discovered that the band gap could be controlled by taking advantage of the [[quantum size effects]] in [[quantum well]] heterostructures. Furthermore, heterostructures can be used as [[waveguide]]s to the [[step-index profile|index step]] which occurs at the interface, another major advantage to their use in semiconductor lasers. Semiconductor [[diode laser]]s used in [[CD]] and [[DVD]] players and [[fiber optic]] [[transceiver]]s are manufactured using alternating layers of various [[Semiconductor materials|III-V]] and [[Semiconductor materials|II-VI]] [[compound semiconductor]]s to form lasing heterostructures.
* ''Bipolar transistors'': When a heterojunction is used as the base-emitter junction of a [[bipolar junction transistor]], extremely high forward [[gain]] and low reverse gain result. This translates into very good high frequency operation (values in tens to hundreds of GHz) and low [[leakage current]]s. This device is called a [[heterojunction bipolar transistor]] (HBT).
* ''Field effect transistors'': Heterojunctions are used in [[HEMT|high electron mobility transistors]] (HEMT) which can operate at significantly higher frequencies (over 500&amp;nbsp;GHz). The proper [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] profile and band alignment gives rise to extremely high [[electron mobility|electron mobilities]] by creating a [[2DEG|two dimensional electron gas]] within a [[intrinsic semiconductor|dopant free region]] where very little [[scattering]] can occur.

== Energy band alignment ==

[[Image:Heterojunction types.png|430px|thumb|right|The three types of semiconductor heterojunctions organized by band alignment.]]
[[File:Straddling gap heterojunction band diagram.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] for straddling gap, ''n''-''n'' semiconductor [[heterojunction]] at equilibrium.]]

The behaviour of a semiconductor junction depends crucially on the alignment of the [[energy band]]s at the interface.
Semiconductor interfaces can be organized into three types of heterojunctions: straddling gap (type I), staggered gap (type II) or broken gap (type III) as seen in the figure.{{fact|date=June 2013}}
Away from the junction, the [[band bending]] can be computed based on the usual procedure of solving [[Poisson's equation]].

Various models exist to predict the band alignment.
* The simplest (and least accurate) model is [[Anderson's rule]], which predicts the band alignment based on the properties of vacuum-semiconductor interfaces (in particular the vacuum [[electron affinity]]). The main limitation is its neglect of chemical bonding.
* A ''common anion rule'' was proposed which guesses that since the valence band is related to anionic states, materials with the same anions should have very small valence band offsets. This however did not explain the data but is related to the trend that two materials with different anions tend to have larger [[valence band]] offsets than [[conduction band]] offsets. 
* Tersoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Tersoff|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.30.4874|title=Theory of semiconductor heterojunctions: The role of quantum dipoles|year=1984|journal=Physical Review B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=4874}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a ''gap state'' model based on more familiar [[metal-semiconductor junction]]s where the conduction band offset is given by the difference in [[Schottky barrier]] height. This model includes a [[dipole]] layer at the interface between the two semiconductors which arises from [[electron tunneling]] from the conduction band of one material into the gap of the other (analogous to [[metal-induced gap states]]). This model agrees well with systems where both materials are closely lattice matched&lt;ref name=&quot;pallab&quot;&gt;Pallab, Bhattacharya (1997), Semiconductor Optoelectronic Devices, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-495656-7&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[GaAs]]/[[AlGaAs]].
* The ''60:40 rule'' is a heuristic for the specific case of junctions between the semiconductor GaAs and the alloy semiconductor Al&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1-''x''&lt;/sub&gt;As. As the ''x'' in the Al&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1-''x''&lt;/sub&gt;As side is varied from 0 to 1, the ratio &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_C/\Delta E_V&lt;/math&gt; tends to maintain the value 60/40. For comparison, Anderson's rule predicts &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_C / \Delta E_V = 0.73/0.27&lt;/math&gt; for a GaAs/AlAs junction (''x''=1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite isbn|9780852965580}} page &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Debbar&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevB.40.1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical method for measuring band offsets is by calculating them from measuring [[exciton]] energies in the [[luminescence]] spectra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debbar&quot; /&gt;

== Effective mass mismatch at heterojunctions ==

When a heterojunction is formed by two different [[semiconductor]]s, a [[quantum well]] can be fabricated due to difference in [[band structure]]. In order to calculate the static [[energy level]]s within the achieved quantum well, understanding variation or mismatch of the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] across the heterojunction becomes substantial. The quantum well defined in the heterojunction can be treated as a finite well potential with width of &lt;math&gt; l_w&lt;/math&gt;. Addition to that, in 1966, Conley et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.150.466|title=Electron Tunneling in Metal-Semiconductor Barriers|year=1966|last1=Conley|first1=J.|last2=Duke|first2=C.|last3=Mahan|first3=G.|last4=Tiemann|first4=J.|journal=Physical Review|volume=150|issue=2|pages=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BenDaniel and Duke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.152.683|title=Space-Charge Effects on Electron Tunneling|year=1966|last1=Bendaniel|first1=D.|last2=Duke|first2=C.|journal=Physical Review|volume=152|issue=2|pages=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported [[boundary condition]] for the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope function]] in quantum well, known as BenDaniel-Duke boundary condition. According to them, the envelope function in fabricated quantum well must satisfy boundary condition which states &lt;math&gt; \psi (z) , {\frac {1} {m^*} }{\partial \over {\partial z}} \psi (z) \,&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous in interface regions.

{{collapse top|Mathematical details worked out for [[quantum well]] example.}}
Using the [[Schrödinger equation]] for a finite well with width of &lt;math&gt;l_w &lt;/math&gt;and center at 0, the equation for the achieved quantum well can be written as:

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_b^*} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \psi(z)}{\mathrm{d}z^2} + V \psi(z) = E \psi(z) \quad \quad \text{ for } z &lt; - \frac {l_w}{2} \quad \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \quad \quad -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_w^*} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \psi(z)}{\mathrm{d}z^2} = E \psi(z) \quad \quad \text{ for } - \frac {l_w}{2} &lt; z &lt; + \frac {l_w}{2} \quad \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_b^*} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \psi(z)}{\mathrm{d}z^2} + V \psi(z) = E \psi(z) \quad \text{ for } z &gt; + \frac {l_w}{2} \quad \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Solution for above equations are well-known, only with different(modified) k and &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, David J. (2004). ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics'' (2nd ed.). Prentice Hall. ISBN 0-13-111892-7&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; k = \frac {\sqrt{2 m_w E}} {\hbar} \quad \quad \kappa = \frac {\sqrt{2 m_b (V-E)}} {\hbar} \quad \quad (4)&lt;/math&gt;.

At the z = &lt;math&gt; + \frac {l_w} {2} &lt;/math&gt; even-parity solution can be gained from
::&lt;Math&gt; A\cos(\frac {k l_w} {2}) = B \exp(- \frac {\kappa l_w} {2}) \quad \quad (5)&lt;/math&gt;.

By taking derivative of (5) and multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {m^*}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;Math&gt; -\frac {kA} {m_w^*} \sin(\frac {k l_w} {2}) = -\frac {\kappa B} {m_b^*} \exp(- \frac {\kappa l_w} {2}) \quad \quad (6)&lt;/math&gt;.

Dividing (6) by (5), even-parity solution function can be obtained,

::&lt;Math&gt; f(E) = -\frac {k} {m_w^*} \tan(\frac {k l_w} {2}) -\frac {\kappa } {m_b^*} = 0 \quad \quad (7)&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, for odd-parity solution,

::&lt;Math&gt; f(E) = -\frac {k} {m_w^*} \cot(\frac {k l_w} {2}) +\frac {\kappa } {m_b^*} = 0 \quad \quad (8)&lt;/math&gt;.

For [[numerical solution]], taking derivatives of (7) and (8) gives

even parity:
::&lt;math&gt; \frac {df}{dE} = \frac {1}{m_w^*} \frac {dk}{dE} \tan(\frac {k l_w} {2}) + \frac {k} {m_w^*} \sec^2(\frac {k l_w} {2}) \times \frac {l_w} {2} \frac {dk} {dE} - \frac {1}{m_b^*} \frac {d \kappa} {dE} \quad \quad (9-1)&lt;/math&gt;
odd parity:
::&lt;math&gt; \frac {df}{dE} = \frac {1}{m_w^*} \frac {dk}{dE} \cot(\frac {k l_w} {2}) - \frac {k} {m_w^*} \csc^2(\frac {k l_w} {2}) \times \frac {l_w} {2} \frac {dk} {dE} + \frac {1}{m_b^*} \frac {d \kappa} {dE} \quad \quad (9-2)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \frac {dk}{dE} = \frac {\sqrt {2 m_w^*}}{2 \sqrt E \hbar} \quad \quad \quad \frac {d \kappa}{dE} = - \frac {\sqrt {2 m_b^*}}{2 \sqrt {V-E} \hbar}&lt;/math&gt;.

The difference in effective mass between materials results in a larger difference in [[ground state]] energies.

== Nanoscale heterojunctions ==
[[Image:Fe3O4-CdS Nano Heterojunction.JPG|400px|thumb|right|Image of a nanoscale heterojunction between iron oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;— sphere) and cadmium sulfide (CdS&amp;nbsp;— rod) taken with a [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]. This staggered gap (type II) offset junction was synthesized by Hunter McDaniel and Dr. Moonsub Shim at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2007.]] 
In [[quantum dot]]s the band energies are dependent on crystal size due to the [[quantum size effects]]. This enables band offset engineering in nanoscale heterostructures. It is possible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja068351m|title=Type-II Core/Shell CdS/ZnSe Nanocrystals:  Synthesis, Electronic Structures, and Spectroscopic Properties|year=2007|last1=Ivanov|first1=Sergei A.|last2=Piryatinski|first2=Andrei|last3=Nanda|first3=Jagjit|last4=Tretiak|first4=Sergei|last5=Zavadil|first5=Kevin R.|last6=Wallace|first6=William O.|last7=Werder|first7=Don|last8=Klimov|first8=Victor I.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=38|pages=11708–19|pmid=17727285}}&lt;/ref&gt; to use the same materials but change the type of junction, say from straddling (type I) to staggered (type II), by changing the size or thickness of the crystals involved. The most common nanoscale heterostructure system is [[ZnS]] on [[CdSe]] (CdSe@ZnS) which has a straddling gap (type I) offset. In this system the much larger [[band gap]] ZnS [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the surface of the [[fluorescent]] CdSe core thereby increasing the [[quantum efficiency]] of the [[luminescence]]. There is an added bonus of increased [[thermal stability]] due to the stronger [[chemical bond|bonds]] in the ZnS shell as suggested by its larger band gap. Since CdSe and ZnS both grow in the [[zincblende (crystal structure)|zincblende]] crystal phase and are closely lattice matched, core shell growth is preferred. In other systems or under different growth conditions it may be possible to grow [[anisotropic]] structures such as the one seen in the image on the right.

It has been shown&lt;ref name=&quot;Robel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja070099a|title=Size-Dependent Electron Injection from Excited CdSe Quantum Dots into TiO2Nanoparticles|year=2007|last1=Robel|first1=István|last2=Kuno|first2=Masaru|last3=Kamat|first3=Prashant V.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=14|pages=4136–7|pmid=17373799}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the driving force for [[Intervalence charge transfer|charge transfer]] between [[conduction band]]s in these structures is the conduction band offset. By decreasing the size of CdSe [[nanocrystal]]s grown on [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], Robel et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robel&quot; /&gt; found that electrons transferred faster from the higher CdSe conduction band into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In CdSe the quantum size effect is much more pronounced in the conduction band due to the smaller effective mass than in the valence band, and this is the case with most semiconductors. Consequently, engineering the conduction band offset is typically much easier with nanoscale heterojunctions. For staggered (type II) offset nanoscale heterojunctions, [[photoinduced charge separation]] can occur since there the lowest energy state for [[electron hole|holes]] may be on one side of the junction whereas the lowest energy for electrons is on the opposite side. It has been suggested&lt;ref name=&quot;Robel&quot; /&gt; that anisotropic staggered gap (type II) nanoscale heterojunctions may be used for [[photocatalysis]], specifically for [[water splitting]] with solar energy.

A '''homojunction''' is a [[semiconductor]] interface that occurs between layers of similar semiconductor material, these materials have equal [[band gap]]s but typically have different [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. In most practical cases a homojunction occurs at the interface between an [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] ([[donor (semiconductors)|donor]] doped) and [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] ([[acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptor]] doped) semiconductor such as [[silicon]], this is called a [[p-n junction]].  This is not a necessary condition as the only requirement is that the same semiconductor (same [[band gap]]) is found on both sides of the junction, in contrast to a [[heterojunction]]. An n-type to n-type junction, for example, would be considered a homojunction if the doping levels are different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4026">The '''common-mode rejection ratio''' (CMRR) of a [[differential amplifier]] (or other device) is the rejection by the device of unwanted input signals common to both input leads, relative to the wanted difference signal. An ideal differential amplifier would have infinite CMRR; this is not achievable in practice. A high CMRR is required when a differential signal must be amplified in the presence of a possibly large common-mode input. An example is audio transmission over [[balanced line]]s.

== Theory ==

Ideally, a differential amplifier takes the voltages, &lt;math&gt;V_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; on its two inputs and produces an output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{o}=A_\mathrm{d}(V_+ - V_-)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential gain. However, the output of a real differential amplifier is better described as
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{o}} = A_\mathrm{d} (V_+ - V_-) + \tfrac{1}{2} A_\mathrm{cm} (V_+ + V_-),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the common-mode gain, which is typically much smaller than the [[differential gain]].

The CMRR is defined as the ratio of the [[Power (physics)|powers]] of the differential gain over the common-mode gain, measured in positive [[decibel]]s (thus using the [[20 log rule]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CMRR} = \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) = 10\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{A_\mathrm{cm}} \right)^2 dB = 20\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) dB&lt;/math&gt;

As differential gain should exceed common-mode gain, this will be a positive number, and the higher the better.

The CMRR is a very important specification, as it indicates how much of the [[common-mode signal]] will appear in your measurement. The value of the CMRR often depends on signal [[frequency]] as well, and must be specified as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] thereof.

It is often important in reducing noise on transmission lines. For example, when measuring the resistance of a [[thermocouple]] in a noisy environment, the [[signal noise|noise]] from the environment appears as an offset on both input leads, making it a common-mode [[voltage]] signal. The CMRR of the measurement instrument determines the [[attenuation]] applied to the offset or noise.

== Example: operational amplifiers ==

[[File:Op-Amp Instrumentation Amplifier.svg|right|thumb|Typical [[instrumentation amplifier]] implementation, designed to have a high CMRR.]]

An [[operational amplifier]] (op-amp) has two inputs, V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, and an [[open-loop gain]] G. In the ideal case, the output of an ideal op-amp behaves according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out} = (V_+ - V_-) \cdot G_\mathrm{openloop}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents an infinite CMRR: if both inputs fluctuate by the same amount (while maintaining a constant difference V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;), this change will have no bearing on the output. In real applications, this is not always the case: the lower the CMRR, the larger the effect on the output signal, following the general equation

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out} = (V_+ - V_-) \cdot G_\mathrm{openloop} \pm \frac {V_\mathrm{cm}}{ 10 ^ {\frac {CMRR}{20}}} &lt;/math&gt;

Where V&lt;sub&gt;CM&lt;/sub&gt; represents the common-mode voltage at the inputs, or (V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;)/2.

The [[Operational amplifier#1968: Release of the .CE.BCA741|741]] (a common op-amp chip) has a CMRR of 90 dB, which is reasonable in most cases. A value of 70 dB may be adequate for applications which are insensitive to the effects on amplifier output;some high-end devices may use op-amps with a CMRR of 120 dB or more.

So for example, an op-amp with 90dB CMRR operating with 10V
of common-mode will have an output error of &amp;plusmn;316uV.

&lt;/ref&gt;—and [[directed graph]]—consisting of nodes and branches. Its '''nodes''' are the variables of a set of linear algebraic relations. An SFG can only represent multiplications and additions. Multiplications are represented by the '''weights''' of the '''branches'''; additions are represented by multiple branches going into one node. A signal-flow graph has a one-to-one relationship with a system of linear equations.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;

In addition to this, it can also be used to represent the '''signal flow''' in a physical system; i.e., it can represent relations of cause and effect.

==Example 1: Simple amplifier==
[[File:Sfg simple amplifier.svg|thumbnail|150px|Figure 1: SFG of a simple amplifier]]
The amplification of a signal ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' by an amplifier with gain ''a&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'' is described mathematically by

::&lt;math&gt;V_2 = a_{12}V_1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship represented by the signal-flow graph of Figure 1. is that V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but it implies no dependency of V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  See Kou page 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kou|1967|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example 2: Two-port network==
[[File:Sfg ymatrix.svg|thumbnail|300px|Figure 2: SFG describing two-port admittance matrix equations]]
In [[electrical circuits]], two equations describing a [[two-port network]] in [[admittance matrix]] form,

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} y_{11} &amp; y_{12} \\ y_{21} &amp; y_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

can be drawn as the SFG shown in Figure 2. This signal-flow graph describes causality properly if and only if V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are designated as inputs.  If any other designation of inputs is made then the SFG is either incomplete or invalid.

==Example 2a: Circuit containing a two-port network==
[[File:Circuit with two port and equivalent signal flow graph.png|lrft|thumb|400px| Signal flow graph of a circuit containing a two port.  The forward path from input to output is shown in a different color.]]

The figure to the right depicts a circuit that contains a two-port network.   V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the input of the circuit and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the output.  The two-port equations impose a set of linear constraints between its port voltages and currents.  The terminal equations impose other constraints.  All these constraints are represented in the SFG (Signal Flow Graph) below the circuit.  There is only one path from input to output which is shown in a different color and has a gain of -R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;.  There are also three loops: -R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, -R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. Sometimes a loop indicates intentional feedback but it can also indicate a constraint on the relationship of two variables.  For example, the equation that describes a resistor says that the ratio of the voltage across the resistor to the current through the resistor is a constant which is called the resistance.  This can be interpreted as the voltage is the input and the current is the output, or the current is the input and the voltage is the output, or merely that the voltage and current have a linear relationship.  Virtually all passive two terminal devices in a circuit will show up in the SFG as a loop.

The SFG and the schematic depict the same circuit, but the schematic also suggests the circuit's purpose.  Compared to the schematic, the SFG is awkward but it does have the advantage that the input to output gain can be written down by inspection using [[Mason's rule]].

==Example 3 Asymptotic gain formula==
[[File:Modified SFG for feedback amplifier.PNG|thumbnail| 300px|Figure 3: A possible signal-flow graph for the [[asymptotic gain model]]]]
[[File:Control parameter.PNG|thumbnail| 300px|Figure 4: A different signal-flow graph for the [[asymptotic gain model]] ]]
:A possible SFG for the [[asymptotic gain model]] for a [[negative feedback amplifier]] is shown in Figure 3, and leads to the equation for the gain of this amplifier as 

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {y_2}{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = G_{\infty} \left( \frac{T}{T + 1} \right) + G_0 \left( \frac{1}{T + 1} \right) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

:The interpretation of the parameters is as follows: ''T'' = [[return ratio]], ''G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = direct amplifier gain, ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = feedforward (indicating the possible [[Electronic_amplifier#Unilateral_or_bilateral|bilateral]] nature of the feedback, possibly deliberate as in the case of feedforward [[Lead-lag compensator|compensation]]). Figure 3 has the interesting aspect that it resembles Figure 2 for the two-port network with the addition of the extra ''feedback relation'' ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =  T y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

:From this gain expression an interpretation of the parameters ''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt;'' is evident, namely:

::&lt;math&gt;G_{\infty} = \lim_{T \to \infty }G\ ; \ G_{0} = \lim_{T \to 0 }G \ . &lt;/math&gt;

:There are many possible SFG's associated with any particular gain relation. Figure 4 shows another SFG for the asymptotic gain model that can be easier to interpret in terms of a circuit. In this graph, parameter  β is interpreted as a feedback factor and ''A'' as a &quot;control parameter&quot;, possibly related to a dependent source in the circuit. Using this graph, the gain is

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {y_2}{x_1}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; = G_{0} +  \frac {A} {1 - \beta A} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

:To connect to the asymptotic gain model, parameters ''A'' and β cannot be arbitrary circuit parameters, but must relate to the return ratio ''T'' by:

:&lt;math&gt; T = - \beta A \ , &lt;/math&gt;

:and to the asymptotic gain as:

:&lt;math&gt; G_{\infty} = \lim_{T \to \infty }G = G_0 - \frac {1} {\beta} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

:Substituting these results into the gain expression,

:&lt;math&gt;G =  G_{0} + \frac {1} {\beta} \frac {-T} {1 +T} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = G_0 + (G_0 - G_{\infty} ) \frac {-T} {1 +T} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = G_{\infty} \frac {T} {1 +T} + G_0 \frac {1}{1+T}  \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

:which is the formula of the asymptotic gain model.  
Signal flow graphs are used in many different subject areas besides control and network theory, for example, stochastic signal processing.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;

==Example 4: Position servo with multi-loop feedback==

[[File:Position servo and signal flow graph.png|right|thumb|800px| Angular position servo and signal flow graph.  θ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = desired angle command, θ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = actual load angle, K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = position loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;ωC&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity command, V&lt;sub&gt;ωM&lt;/sub&gt; = motor velocity sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = velocity loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; = current command, V&lt;sub&gt;IM&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense voltage, K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = current loop gain, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = power amplifier output voltage, L&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor inductance, V&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = voltage across motor inductance, I&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor current, R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = current sense resistance, K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor torque constant (Nm/amp), T = torque, M = moment of inertia  of all rotating components α = angular acceleration, ω = angular velocity, β = mechanical damping, G&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = motor back EMF constant, G&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = tachometer conversion gain constant,.  There is one forward path (shown in  a different color) and six feedback loops.  The drive shaft assumed to be stiff enough to not treat as a spring.  Constants are shown in black and variables in purple.]]

This example is representative of a SFG (signal-flow graph) used to represent a servo control system and illustrates several features of SFGs.  Some of the loops (loop 3, loop 4 and loop 5) are extrinsic intentionally designed feedback loops.  These are shown with dotted lines.  There are also intrinsic loops (loop 0, loop1, loop2) that are not intentional feedback loops, although they can be analyzed as though they were.  These loops are shown with solid lines.  Loop 3 and loop 4 are also known as minor loops because they are inside a larger loop.

*The forward path begins with &lt;math&gt; \theta_C \, &lt;/math&gt;, the desired position command.  This is multiplied by K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; which could be a constant or a function of frequency.  K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; incorporates the conversion gain of the DAC and any filtering on the DAC output.  The output of K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity command &lt;math&gt; V_{\omega C} \, &lt;/math&gt; which is multiplied by K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; which can be a constant or a function of frequency.  The output of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; is the current command, V&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; which is multiplied by K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; which can be a constant or a function of frequency.  The output of K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; the amplifier output voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. The current, I&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, though the motor winding is the integral of the voltage applied to the inductance.  The motor produces a torque, T, proportional to I&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;.  Permanent magnet motors tend to have a linear current to torque function.  The conversion constant of current to torque is K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;.  The torque, T, divided by the load moment of inertia, M, is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt; \alpha \, &lt;/math&gt;, which is integrated to give the load velocity &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt; which is integrated to produce the load position, &lt;math&gt; \theta_L \, &lt;/math&gt;.

*The forward path of loop 0 asserts that acceleration is proportional to torque and the velocity is the time integral of acceleration.  The backward path says that as the speed increases there is a friction or drag that counteracts the torque.  Torque on the load decreases proportionately to the load velocity until the point is reached that all the torque is used to overcome friction and the acceleration drops to zero. Loop 0 is intrinsic.

*Loop1 represents the interaction of an inductor's current with its internal and external series resistance.  The current through an inductance is the time integral of the voltage across the inductance.  When a voltage is first applied, all of it appears across the inductor.  This is shown by the forward path through &lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {s L_M} \, &lt;/math&gt;.  As the current increases, voltage is dropped across the inductor internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and the external resistance R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.  This reduces the voltage across the inductor and is represented by the feedback path -(R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;).  The current continues to increase but at a steadily decreasing rate until the current reaches the point at which all the voltage is dropped across (R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;). Loop 1 is intrinsic.

*Loop2 expresses the effect of the motor back EMF.  Whenever a permanent magnet motor rotates, it acts like a generator and produces a voltage in its windings.  It does not matter whether the rotation is caused by a torque applied to the drive shaft or by current applied to the windings.  This voltage is referred to as back EMF.  The conversion gain of rotational velocity to back EMF is G&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;.  The polarity of the back EMF is such that it diminishes the voltage across the winding inductance. Loop 2 is intrinsic.

*Loop 3 is extrinsic.  The current in the motor winding passes through a sense resister.  The voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;IM&lt;/sub&gt;, developed across the sense resister is fed back to the negative terminal of the power amplifier K&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.  This feedback causes the voltage amplifier to act like a voltage controlled current source.  Since the motor torque is proportional to motor current, the sub-system V&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; to the output torque acts like a voltage controlled torque source.  This sub-system may be referred to as the &quot;current loop&quot; or &quot;torque loop&quot;.  Loop 3 effectively diminishes the effects of loop 1 and loop 2.

*Loop 4 is extrinsic.  A tachometer (actually a low power dc generator) produces an output voltage &lt;math&gt; V_ {\omega M} \, &lt;/math&gt; that is proportional to is angular velocity.  This voltage is fed to the negative input of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;.  This feedback causes the sub-system from &lt;math&gt; V_ {\omega C} \, &lt;/math&gt; to the load angular velocity to act like a voltage to velocity source.  This sub-system may be referred to as the &quot;velocity loop&quot;.  Loop 4 effectively diminishes the effects of loop 0 and loop 3.

*Loop 5 is extrinsic.  This is the overall position feedback loop.  The feedback comes from an angle encoder that produces a digital output.  The output position is subtracted from the desired position by digital hardware which drives a DAC which drives K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;.  In the SFG, the conversion gain of the DAC is incorporated into K&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3400">'''Common-mode signal''' is the component of an [[analog signal]] which is present with one sign on all considered [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s. In [[telecommunication]], common-mode signal on a [[transmission line]] is known as '''longitudinal voltage'''.

In [[electronics]] where the signal is transferred by differential voltage, the common-mode signal is a half-sum of voltages

:&lt;math&gt;U_{cm} = \frac{U_1 + U_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

When referenced to the local common or ground, a common-mode signal appears on both lines of a two-wire cable, in-phase and with equal amplitudes. Technically, a common-mode voltage is one-half the vector sum of the voltages from each conductor of a balanced circuit to local ground or common. Such signals can arise from one or more of the following sources:
* Radiated signals coupled equally to both lines, 
* An offset from signal common created in the driver circuit, or 
* A ground differential between the transmitting and receiving locations. 

Noise induced into a cable, or transmitted from a cable usually occurs in the common mode; i.e. the same signal tends to be picked up by both conductors in a two wire cable.  Likewise, RF noise transmitted from a cable tends to emanate from both conductors. Elimination of common mode signals on cables entering or leaving electronic equipment is important to ensure [[electromagnetic compatibility]]. Unless the intention is to transmit or receive radio signals, an electronic designer will generally design electronic circuits to minimise or eliminate common mode effects.

==Methods of eliminating common mode signals==

* [[Differential amplifier]]s or receivers that respond only to voltage differences, ''e.g.,'' those between the wires that constitute a pair. This method is particularly suited for instrumentation where signals are transmitted through DC bias.
* An inductor where a pair of signalling wires follow the same path through the inductor. E.g. in a [[bifilar winding]] configuration such as used in Ethernet magnetics.&lt;ref&gt;http://pulseeng.com/products/datasheets/H325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Useful for AC and DC signals, but will filter only higher frequency common mode signals.
* A transformer, which is useful for AC signals only, and will filter any form of common mode noise, but may be used in combination with a bifilar wound coil to eliminate capacitive coupling of higher frequency common mode signals across the transformer. Used in twisted pair Ethernet.&lt;ref&gt;http://pulseeng.com/products/datasheets/H325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Common mode filtering may also be used to prevent egress of noise for electromagnetic compatibility purposes.
 
High frequency common mode signals, for example, [[Radio frequency|RF]] noise from a computing circuit, may be blocked using a ferrite bead clamped to the outside of a cable. These are often observable on laptop computer power supplies near the jack socket, and good quality mouse or printer USB cables and HDMI cables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmac.co.uk/pdfs/ferrite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Switched-mode power supply|Switch mode power supplies]]  include common and differential mode filtering inductors to block the switching signal noise returning into mains wiring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hottconsultants.com/pdf_files/APEC-2002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">In [[electronics]], '''Complex gain''' is the effect circuitry has on the [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[sine wave]] signal. The term ''complex'' is used because mathematically this effect can be expressed as a [[complex number]].

==Example==
Suppose a circuit has an input voltage described by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{i}(t) = 1V \cdot \sin (\omega \cdot t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ω equals 2π&amp;times;100Hz, i.e., the input signal is a 100Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 1 Volt.

If the circuit is such that for this frequency it doubles the signal's amplitude and causes a 90 degrees forward phase shift, then its output signal can be described by

:&lt;math&gt;V_{i}(t) = 2V \cdot \cos (\omega \cdot t)&lt;/math&gt;

In complex notation, these signals can be described as, for this frequency, ''j''·1V and 2V, respectively.

The complex gain ''G'' of this circuit is then computed by dividing output by input:

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {2V}{j\cdot1V} = -2j.&lt;/math&gt;

This (unitless) complex number incorporates both the magnitude of the change in amplitude (as the [[Absolute_value#Complex_numbers|absolute value]]) and the phase change (as the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1196">In [[electronics]], a  '''constant current''' system is a system that can vary the voltage across an [[electronic circuit]] to maintain a constant [[electric current]]. When a [[electrical component|component]] is indicated to be driven by a constant current, the [[driver circuit]] is, in essence, a [[current regulator]] and must appear to the component as a [[current source]] of suitable reliability. 

An important usage of constant current [[power supplies]] is with [[LED]]s. While a high [[series resistance]] is sufficient to light an LED, sometimes the design needs to guard against high current (or risk burning out the LEDs). Another use is in [[fluorescent lamp]]s which have very dynamic [[electrical resistance]] and are optimally operated within a short range of currents. &lt;ref&gt; Caladen Circuit Corner, before Sep 5 2009, [http://caladan.nanosoft.ca/c4/ccorner/4.php LED Current Controller]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses include [[shielded metal arc welding]] and [[gas tungsten arc welding]].

They are also used to describe the [[small-signal]] ([[linearization|linearized]]) response of non-linear networks. They are members of a family of similar parameters used in electronic engineering, other examples being: [[S-parameters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David M. Pozar| title = Microwave Engineering| date = 2004-02-05| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 978-0-471-44878-5| pages = 170-174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Y-parameters]],&lt;ref&gt;David M. Pozar, 2005 (op. cit); pp 170-174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Two port#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)|H-parameters]], [[T-parameters]] or [[Two-port network#ABCD-parameters|ABCD-parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Pozar, 2005 (op. cit); pp 183-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Morton, '' Advanced Electrical Engineering'', Pitman Publishing Ltd., 1985; pp 33-72, ISBN 0-273-40172-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Z-parameters are also known as ''open-circuit impedance parameters'' as they are calculated under [[wikt:open circuit|open circuit]] conditions. i.e., I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;=0, where x=1,2 refer to input and output currents flowing through the ports (of a [[two-port network]] in this case) respectively.

==The Z-parameter matrix==
A Z-parameter matrix describes the behaviour of any linear electrical network that can be regarded as a [[black box]] with a number of ports. A ''port'' in this context is a pair of [[terminal (electronics)|electrical terminals]] carrying equal and opposite currents into and out-of the network, and having a particular [[voltage]] between them. The Z-matrix gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate.

For a generic multi-port network definition, it is assumed that each of the ports is allocated an integer ''n'' ranging from 1 to ''N'', where ''N'' is the total number of ports. For port ''n'', the associated Z-parameter definition is in terms of the port current and port voltage, &lt;math&gt;I_n\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_n\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

For all ports the voltages may be defined in terms of the Z-parameter matrix and the currents by the following matrix equation:

:&lt;math&gt;V = Z I\,&lt;/math&gt;

where Z is an ''N'' × ''N'' matrix the elements of which can be indexed using conventional [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation. In general the elements of the Z-parameter matrix are [[complex number]]s and functions of frequency. For a one-port network, the Z-matrix reduces to a single element, being the ordinary [[electrical impedance|impedance]] measured between the two terminals.The Z-parameters are also known as the open circuit parameters as for their determination we need to open circuit one port and analyze the currents and voltages through other ports.

==Two-port networks==
[[File:Two-Port Z-parameters Thevenin equivalent.svg|thumb|The equivalent circuit for Z-parameters of a two-port network.]]
[[File:Two-Port Z-parameters reciprocal equivalent.svg|thumb|The equivalent circuit for Z-parameters of a [[Reciprocity_(electromagnetism)#Reciprocity_for_electrical_networks|reciprocal]] two-port network. .]]

The Z-parameter matrix for the [[two-port network]] is probably the most common. In this case the relationship between the port currents, port voltages and the Z-parameter matrix is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;{V_1 \choose V_2} = \begin{pmatrix} Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} \\ Z_{21} &amp; Z_{22} \end{pmatrix}{I_1 \choose I_2} &lt;/math&gt;.

where

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{11} = {V_1 \over I_1 } \bigg|_{I_2 = 0} \qquad Z_{12} = {V_1 \over I_2 } \bigg|_{I_1 = 0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{21} = {V_2 \over I_1 } \bigg|_{I_2 = 0} \qquad Z_{22} = {V_2 \over I_2 } \bigg|_{I_1 = 0}&lt;/math&gt;

For the general case of an ''N''-port network,
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{nm} = {V_n \over I_m } \bigg|_{I_k = 0 \text{ for } k \ne m}&lt;/math&gt;

===Impedance relations===

The input impedance of a two-port network is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{in} = Z_{11} - \frac{Z_{12}Z_{21}}{Z_{22}+Z_L}&lt;/math&gt;

where Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance of the load connected to port two.

Similarly, the output impedance is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{out} = Z_{22} - \frac{Z_{12}Z_{21}}{Z_{11}+Z_S}&lt;/math&gt;

where Z&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance of the source connected to port one.

==Relation to S-parameters==

The Z-parameters of a network are related to its [[S-parameters]] by&lt;ref name=&quot;Russer&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Russer| first = Peter| title = Electromagnetics, microwave circuit and antenna design for communications engineering| year = 2003| publisher = Artech House| isbn = 1-58053-532-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
Z &amp;= \sqrt{z} (1_{\!N} + S) (1_{\!N} - S)^{-1} \sqrt{z} \\
  &amp;= \sqrt{z} (1_{\!N} - S)^{-1} (1_{\!N} + S) \sqrt{z} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;

and&lt;ref name=Russer/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
S &amp;= (\sqrt{y}Z\sqrt{y} \,- 1_{\!N}) (\sqrt{y}Z\sqrt{y} \,+ 1_{\!N})^{-1} \\
  &amp;= (\sqrt{y}Z\sqrt{y} \,+ 1_{\!N})^{-1} (\sqrt{y}Z\sqrt{y} \,- 1_{\!N}) \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;

where &lt;math&gt;1_{\!N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]], &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[diagonal matrix]] having the square root of the [[characteristic impedance]] at each port as its non-zero elements,

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z} = \begin{pmatrix}
 \sqrt{z_{01}} &amp;  \\
               &amp; \sqrt{z_{02}} \\
               &amp;            &amp; \ddots \\
               &amp;            &amp;           &amp; \sqrt{z_{0N}}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y} = (\sqrt{z})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding diagonal matrix of square roots of [[characteristic admittance]]s. In these expressions the matrices represented by the bracketed factors [[Commuting matrices|commute]] and so, as shown above, may be written in either order.&lt;ref name=Russer/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Any square matrix commutes with itself and with the identity matrix, and if two matrices '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' commute, then so do '''''A''''' and '''''B'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (since '''''AB'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''''B'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''BAB'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''''B'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''ABB'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''''B'''''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''A''''')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two port===
In the special case of a two-port network, with the same characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;z_{01} = z_{02} = Z_0&lt;/math&gt; at each port, the above expressions reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{11} = {((1 + S_{11}) (1 - S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \over \Delta_S} Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{12} = {2 S_{12} \over \Delta_S} Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{21} = {2 S_{21} \over \Delta_S} Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{22} = {((1 - S_{11}) (1 + S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \over \Delta_S} Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_S = (1 - S_{11}) (1 - S_{22}) - S_{12} S_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The two-port S-parameters may be obtained from the equivalent two-port Z-parameters by means of the following expressions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Simon Ramo| coauthors = John R. Whinnery, Theodore Van Duzer| title = Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics| date = 1994-02-09| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 978-0-471-58551-0| pages = 537-541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{11} = {(Z_{11} - Z_0) (Z_{22} + Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \over \Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{12} = {2 Z_0 Z_{12} \over \Delta} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{21} = {2 Z_0 Z_{21} \over \Delta} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{22} = {(Z_{11} + Z_0) (Z_{22} - Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \over \Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = (Z_{11} + Z_0) (Z_{22} + Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The above expressions will generally use complex numbers for &lt;math&gt;S_{ij} \, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij} \, &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta\, &lt;/math&gt; can become 0 for specific values of &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij} \, &lt;/math&gt; so the division by &lt;math&gt;\Delta \, &lt;/math&gt; in the calculations of &lt;math&gt;S_{ij} \,&lt;/math&gt; may lead to a division by 0.

==Relation to Y-parameters==

Conversion from [[Y-parameters]] to Z-parameters is much simpler, as the Z-parameter matrix is just the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the Y-parameter matrix. For a two-port:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{11} = {Y_{22} \over \Delta_Y} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{12} = {-Y_{12} \over \Delta_Y} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{21} = {-Y_{21} \over \Delta_Y} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{22} = {Y_{11} \over \Delta_Y} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_Y = Y_{11} Y_{22} - Y_{12} Y_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[determinant]] of the Y-parameter matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9560">[[Image:Current division example.svg|thumbnail|250px|Figure 1: Schematic of an electrical circuit illustrating current division. Notation ''R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''  refers to the ''total'' resistance of the circuit to the right of resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]

In [[electronics]], a '''current divider ''' is a simple [[linear circuit]] that produces an output [[Electric current|current]] (''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) that is a fraction of its input current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;). '''Current division''' refers to the splitting of current between the branches of the divider. The currents in the various branches of such a circuit will always divide in such a way as to minimize the total energy expended.

The formula describing a current divider is similar in form to that for the [[voltage divider]]. However, the ratio describing current division places the impedance of the unconsidered branches in the [[numerator]], unlike voltage division where the considered impedance is in the numerator. This is because in current dividers, total energy expended is minimized, resulting in currents that go through paths of least impedance, therefore the inverse relationship with impedance.  On the other hand, voltage divider is used to satisfy [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]].  The voltage around a loop must sum up to zero, so the voltage drops must be divided evenly in a direct relationship with the impedance.

To be specific, if two or more [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s are in parallel, the current that enters the combination will be split between them in inverse proportion to their impedances (according to [[Ohm's law]]). It also follows that if the impedances have the same value the current is split equally.

==Current divider==
A general formula for the current ''I&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' in a resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' that is in parallel with a combination of other resistors of total resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is (see Figure 1):

:&lt;math&gt;I_X = \frac{R_T}{(R_X+R_T)}I_T \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total current entering the combined network of ''R&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' in parallel with ''R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''. Notice that when ''R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is composed of a [[Series_and_parallel_circuits#Parallel_circuits|parallel combination]] of resistors, say ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ... ''etc.'', then the reciprocal of each resistor must be added to find the total resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'':
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{R_T} = \frac {1} {R_1} + \frac {1} {R_2} + \frac {1}{R_3} + ... \ . &lt;/math&gt;

==General case==
Although the resistive divider is most common, the current divider may be made of frequency dependent [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s. In the general case the current I&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;I_X = \frac{Z_T} {Z_X+Z_T}I_T \ ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Alexander| first2=Matthew |last2=Sadiku| title=Fundamentals of Electric Circuits|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-128441-7|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using Admittance==
Instead of using [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, the current divider rule can be applied just like the [[voltage divider]] rule if [[admittance]] (the inverse of impedance) is used.
:&lt;math&gt;I_X = \frac{Y_X} {Y_{Total}}I_T&lt;/math&gt;
Take care to note that Y&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; is a straightforward addition, not the sum of the inverses inverted (as you would do for a standard parallel resistive network). For Figure 1, the current I&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; would be
:&lt;math&gt;I_X = \frac{Y_X} {Y_{Total}}I_T = \frac{\frac{1}{R_X}} {\frac{1}{R_X} + \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}I_T&lt;/math&gt;

===Example: RC combination===
[[Image:Low pass RC filter.PNG|thumbnail|220px|Figure 2: A low pass RC current divider]]
Figure 2 shows a simple current divider made up of a [[capacitor]] and a resistor. Using the formula above, the current in the resistor is given by:

::&lt;math&gt; I_R = \frac {\frac{1}{j \omega C}} {R + \frac{1}{j \omega C} }I_T &lt;/math&gt; 
:::&lt;math&gt; = \frac {1} {1+j \omega CR} I_T  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/(jωC) '' is the impedance of the capacitor and &lt;var&gt;j&lt;/var&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]].

The product ''τ = CR'' is known as the [[time constant]] of the circuit, and the frequency for which ωCR = 1 is called the [[corner frequency]] of the circuit. Because the capacitor has zero impedance at high frequencies and infinite impedance at low frequencies, the current in the resistor remains at its DC value ''I&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' for frequencies up to the corner frequency, whereupon it drops toward zero for higher frequencies as the capacitor effectively [[short-circuit]]s the resistor. In other words, the current divider is a [[low pass filter]] for current in the resistor.

==Loading effect==
[[File:Current Division.svg|thumbnail|300px|Figure 3: A current amplifier (gray box) driven by a Norton source (''i&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') and with a resistor load ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. Current divider in blue box at input (''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'',''R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'') reduces the current gain, as does the current divider in green box at the output (''R&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;'',''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'')]]
The gain of an amplifier generally depends on its source and load terminations. Current amplifiers and transconductance amplifiers are characterized by a short-circuit output condition, and current amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers are characterized using ideal infinite impedance current sources. When an amplifier is terminated by a finite, non-zero termination, and/or driven by a non-ideal source, the effective gain is reduced due to the '''loading effect''' at the output and/or the input, which can be understood in terms of current division. 

Figure 3 shows a current amplifier example. The amplifier (gray box) has input resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' and output resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;'' and an ideal current gain ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. With an ideal current driver (infinite Norton resistance) all the source current ''i&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes input current to the amplifier. However, for a [[Norton's theorem|Norton driver]] a current divider is formed at the input that reduces the input current to

::&lt;math&gt;i_{i} = \frac {R_S} {R_S+R_{in}} i_S \ , &lt;/math&gt;

which clearly is less than ''i&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. Likewise, for a short circuit at the output, the amplifier delivers an output current ''i&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the short-circuit. However, when the load is a non-zero resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', the current delivered to the load is reduced by current division to the value:

::&lt;math&gt;i_L = \frac {R_{out}} {R_{out}+R_{L}} A_i  i_{i} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Combining these results, the ideal current gain ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' realized with an ideal driver and a short-circuit load is reduced to the '''loaded gain''' ''A&lt;sub&gt;loaded&lt;/sub&gt;'':

::&lt;math&gt;A_{loaded} =\frac {i_L} {i_S} =  \frac {R_S} {R_S+R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac {R_{out}} {R_{out}+R_{L}} A_i  \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The resistor ratios in the above expression are called the '''loading factors'''. For more discussion of loading in other amplifier types, see [[Voltage division#Loading effect|loading effect]].

===Unilateral versus bilateral amplifiers===
[[Image:H-parameter current amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|300px|Figure 4: Current amplifier as a bilateral two-port network; feedback through dependent voltage source of gain β V/V]]
Figure 3 and the associated discussion refers to a [[Electronic amplifier#Unilateral or bilateral|unilateral]] amplifier. In a more general case where the amplifier is represented by a [[two-port network|two port]], the input resistance of the amplifier depends on its load, and the output resistance on the source impedance. The loading factors in these cases must employ the true amplifier impedances including these bilateral effects. For example, taking the unilateral current amplifier of Figure 3, the corresponding bilateral two-port network is shown in Figure 4 based upon [[Two-port network#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)| h-parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Two-port network#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)|h-parameter two port]] is the only two-port among the four standard choices that has a current-controlled current source on the output side.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying out the analysis for this circuit, the current gain with feedback ''A&lt;sub&gt;fb&lt;/sub&gt;'' is found to be

::&lt;math&gt; A_{fb} = \frac {i_L}{i_S} = \frac {A_{loaded}} {1+ {\beta}(R_L/R_S) A_{loaded}} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the ideal current gain ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is reduced not only by the loading factors, but due to the bilateral nature of the two-port by an additional factor&lt;ref&gt;Often called the ''improvement factor'' or the ''desensitivity factor''.&lt;/ref&gt; ( 1 + β (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; ) A&lt;sub&gt;loaded&lt;/sub&gt; ), which is typical of [[negative feedback amplifier]] circuits. The factor β (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; ) is the current feedback provided by the voltage feedback source of voltage gain β V/V. For instance, for an ideal current source with ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ∞ Ω, the voltage feedback has no influence, and for ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 Ω, there is zero load voltage, again disabling the feedback.

[[File:Bandwidth.svg|thumb|right|320px|Magnitude transfer function of a bandpass filter with lower 3&amp;nbsp;dB cutoff frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and upper 3 dB cutoff frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

[[File:Butterworth response.svg|right|thumb|320px|A [[bode plot]] of the [[Butterworth filter]]'s [[frequency response]], with corner frequency labeled.  (The slope −20 dB per decade also equals −6 dB per octave.)]]

In [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''cutoff frequency''', '''corner frequency''', or '''break frequency''' is a boundary in a system's [[frequency response]] at which energy flowing through the system begins to be reduced ([[attenuation|attenuated]] or reflected) rather than passing through.  

Typically in electronic systems such as [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] and [[communication channel]]s, cutoff frequency applies to an edge in a [[lowpass]], [[highpass]], [[bandpass]], or [[band-stop]] characteristic – a frequency characterizing a boundary between a passband and a stopband. It is sometimes taken to be the point in the filter response where a [[transition band]] and passband meet, for example, as defined by a 3 [[Decibel|dB]] corner (a frequency for which the output of the circuit is −3&amp;nbsp;dB of the nominal passband value).  Alternatively, a [[stopband]] corner frequency may be specified as a point where a transition band and a stopband meet: a frequency for which the attenuation is larger than the required stopband attenuation, which for example may be 30&amp;nbsp;dB or 100&amp;nbsp;dB.

In the case of a [[waveguide]] or an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], the cutoff frequencies correspond to the lower and upper '''cutoff wavelengths'''.

==Electronics==
In [[electronics]], cutoff frequency or corner frequency is the [[frequency]] either above or below which the power [[output]] of a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]], such as a [[telephone line|line]], amplifier, or [[electronic filter]] has fallen to a given proportion of the power in the [[passband]].  Most frequently this proportion is one half the passband power, also referred to as the 3&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] point since a fall of 3&amp;nbsp;dB corresponds approximately to half power.  As a voltage ratio this is a fall to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{1/2} \ \approx \ 0.707&lt;/math&gt; of the passband voltage.  &lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ratios besides the 3dB point may also be relevant, for example see Chebyshev Filters below.

===Single-pole transfer function example===
The simplest low-pass filter [[transfer function]],

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac {1}{1+\alpha s}&lt;/math&gt; ,

has a single [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at {{math|1=''s'' = -1/α}}.  The magnitude of this function in the {{math|''j''ω}} plane is

:&lt;math&gt;\left | H(j\omega) \right | = \left |  \frac {1}{1+\alpha j \omega} \right | =\sqrt{ \frac {1}{1 + \alpha^2\omega^2}}&lt;/math&gt; .

At cutoff

:&lt;math&gt;\left | H(j\omega_ \mathrm c) \right | = \frac {1}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{ \frac {1}{1 + \alpha^2\omega_\mathrm c ^2}}&lt;/math&gt; .

Hence, the cutoff frequency is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_ \mathrm c = \frac {1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; .

Where {{math|''s''}} is the [[s-plane]] variable, {{math|ω}} is [[angular frequency]] and {{math|''j''}} is the [[imaginary unit]].

===Chebyshev Filters===
Sometimes other ratios are more convenient than the 3dB point.  For instance, in the case of the [[Chebyshev filter]] it is usual to define the cutoff frequency as the point after the last peak in the frequency response at which the level has fallen to the design value of the passband ripple.  The amount of ripple in this class of filter can be set by the designer to any desired value, hence the ratio used could be any value.&lt;ref&gt;Mathaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', pp.85-86, McGraw-Hill 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications==
In [[Telecommunication|communications]], the term cutoff frequency can mean the frequency below which a [[radio wave]] fails to penetrate a layer of the [[ionosphere]] at the incidence angle required for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] between two specified points by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] from the layer.

==Waveguides==
The cutoff frequency of an [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|electromagnetic waveguide]] is the lowest frequency for which a mode will propagate in it. In [[fiber optics]], it is more common to consider the '''cutoff wavelength''', the maximum [[wavelength]] that will propagate in an [[optical fiber]] or [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguide]]. The cutoff frequency is found with the [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] of the [[Helmholtz equation]] for electromagnetic waves, which is derived from the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] by setting the longitudinal [[wave number]] equal to zero and solving for the frequency.  Thus, any exciting frequency lower than the cutoff frequency will attenuate, rather than propagate.  The following derivation assumes lossless walls.  The value of c, the [[speed of light]], should be taken to be the [[group velocity]] of light in whatever material fills the waveguide.

For a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_{c} = c \sqrt{\left(\frac{n \pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m \pi}{b}\right) ^2}, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where the integers &lt;math&gt;n,m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; are the mode numbers, and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. For TE modes, &lt;math&gt; n,m \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (but &lt;math&gt; n = m = 0&lt;/math&gt; is not allowed), while for TM modes &lt;math&gt; n, m \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

The cutoff frequency of the TM&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; mode (next higher from dominant mode TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) in a waveguide of circular cross-section (the transverse-magnetic mode with no angular dependence and lowest radial dependence) is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_{c} = c \frac{\chi_{01}}{r} = c \frac{2.4048}{r},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the waveguide, and  &lt;math&gt;\chi_{01}&lt;/math&gt; is the first root of &lt;math&gt;J_{0}(r)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[bessel function]] of the first kind of order 1.

The dominant mode TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; cutoff frequency is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_{c} = c \frac{\chi_{11}}{r} = c \frac{1.8412}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. C. Hunter, ''Theory and Design of Microwave Filters'', p.214 IET, 2001 ISBN 0-85296-777-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a [[single-mode optical fiber]], the cutoff wavelength is the wavelength at which the [[normalized frequency (fiber optics)|normalized frequency]] is approximately equal to 2.405.

===Mathematical analysis===
The starting point is the wave equation (which is derived from the [[Maxwell equations]]),
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial{t}^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r},t)=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
which becomes a [[Helmholtz equation]] by considering only functions of the form 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi(x,y,z,t) = \psi(x,y,z)e^{i \omega t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting and evaluating the time derivative gives
:&lt;math&gt;
  (\nabla^2 + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}) \psi(x,y,z) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; here refers to whichever field (the electric field or the magnetic field) has no vector component in the longitudinal direction - the &quot;transverse&quot; field.  It is a property of all the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic waveguide that at least one of the two fields is transverse. The ''z'' axis is defined to be along the axis of the waveguide. 

The &quot;longitudinal&quot; derivative in the [[Laplacian]] can further be reduced by considering only functions of the form 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi(x,y,z,t) = \psi(x,y)e^{i \left(\omega t - k_{z} z \right)},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_z&lt;/math&gt; is the longitudinal [[wavenumber]], resulting in
:&lt;math&gt;
  (\nabla_{T}^2 - k_{z}^2 + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}) \psi(x,y,z) = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
where subscript T indicates a 2-dimensional transverse Laplacian.  The final step depends on the geometry of the waveguide.  The easiest geometry to solve is the rectangular waveguide.  In that case the remainder of the Laplacian can be evaluated to its characteristic equation by considering solutions of the form 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi(x,y,z,t) = \psi_{0}e^{i \left(\omega t - k_{z} z - k_{x} x - k_{y} y\right)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus for the rectangular guide the Laplacian is evaluated, and we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} = k_{x}^2 + k_{y}^2 + k_{z}^2
&lt;/math&gt;
The transverse wavenumbers can be specified from the standing wave boundary conditions for a rectangular geometry crossection with dimensions ''a'' and ''b'':
:&lt;math&gt;
  k_{x} = \frac{n \pi}{a},
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  k_{y} = \frac{m \pi}{b},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' and ''m'' are the two integers representing a specific eigenmode.  Performing the final substitution, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\omega^2}{c^2} = \left(\frac{n \pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m \pi}{b}\right)^2 + k_{z}^2,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[dispersion relation]] in the rectangular waveguide. The cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical frequency between propagation and attenuation, which corresponds to the frequency at which the longitudinal wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_{z}&lt;/math&gt; is zero. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \omega_{c} = c \sqrt{\left(\frac{n \pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m \pi}{b}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
The wave equations are also valid below the cutoff frequency, where the longitudinal wave number is imaginary. In this case, the field decays exponentially along the waveguide axis and the wave is thus [[Evanescent wave|evanescent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">In [[electronics]], the '''cut-off voltage''' is the voltage at which a battery is considered fully discharged, and it is good practice to stop discharge at this point. Some electronic devices, such as cell phones, will automatically shut down when the cut-off voltage has been reached.

==Batteries==
In batteries,the cut-off (final) voltage is the prescribed lower-limit voltage at which [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] discharge is considered complete. The cut-off voltage is usually chosen so that the maximum useful capacity of the battery is achieved. The cut-off voltage is different from one battery to the other and it's highly dependent on the type of battery and the kind of service in which the battery is used. When testing the capacity of a [[NiMH]] or [[Nickel-cadmium battery|NiCd battery]] a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V is normally used. 0.9V is normally used as the cut-off voltage of an [[alkaline cell]]. Devices that have too high cut-off voltages may stop operating while the battery still has significant capacity remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warner|first=R. M., Jr.  |date=June 1963|title=Epitaxial FET cut-off voltage|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=51|issue=6|pages=939–940|issn=	0018-9219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage cut-off in portable electronics===
Some [[wikt:portable|portable]] equipment does not fully use the low-end voltage spectrum of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The power to the equipment cuts off before a relatively large portion of the battery life has been used.

A high cut-off voltage is more widespread than perhaps assumed. For example, a certain brand of mobile phone that is powered with a single-cell [[Lithium-ion battery]] cuts off at 3.3V. The Li‑ion can be discharged to 3V and lower. With a discharge to 3.3V, only about 70% of the capacity is used.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

However, particularly in the case of lithium ion batteries which are used in the vast majority of portable electronics today, a voltage cut-off below 3.2V can lead to chemical instability in the cell. The result being a reduced battery lifetime. For this reason, electronics manufacturers tend to use higher cut-off voltages, removing the need for consumers to buy battery replacements before other failure mechanisms in a device take effect.

'''Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio''' ('''SQNR''' or '''SN&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;R''') is widely used quality measure in analysing [[digitizing]] schemes such as PCM ([[Pulse-code modulation|pulse code modulation]]) and [[multimedia codec]]s. The SQNR reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal [[signal strength]] and the [[quantization error]] (also known as quantization noise)  introduced in the [[analog-to-digital conversion]].

The SQNR formula is derived from the general SNR ([[signal-to-noise ratio|Signal-to-Noise Ratio]]) formula for the binary pulse-code [[Modulation|modulated]] [[Channel (communications)|communication channel]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}=\frac{3 \times 2^{2n}}{1+4P_e \times (2^{2n} - 1)} \frac{m_m(t)^2}{m_p(t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of received bit error
:&lt;math&gt;m_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the peak message signal level
:&lt;math&gt;m_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mean message signal level

As SQNR applies to quantized signals, the formulae for SQNR refer to discrete-time digital signals. Instead of &lt;math&gt;m(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we will use the digitized signal &lt;math&gt;x(n)&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; quantization steps, each sample, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; requires &lt;math&gt;\nu=\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; bits. The [[probability distribution function]] (pdf) representing the distribution of values in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The maximum magnitude value of any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;x_{max}&lt;/math&gt;.

As SQNR, like SNR, is a ratio of signal power to some noise power, it can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{E[x^2]}{E[\tilde{x}^2]}&lt;/math&gt;
The signal power is:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x^2} = E[x^2] = P_{x^\nu}=\int_{}^{}x^2f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; 
The quantization noise power can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;E[\tilde{x}^2] = \frac{x_{max}^2}{3\times4^\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
Giving:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = \frac{3 \times 4^\nu\times \overline{x^2}}{x_{max}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When the SQNR is desired in terms of [[Decibels|Decibels (dB)]], a useful approximation to SQNR is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR}|_{dB}=P_{x^\nu}+6\nu+4.8&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits in a quantized sample, and &lt;math&gt;P_{x^\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the signal power calculated above. Note that for each bit added to a sample, the SQNR goes up by approximately 6dB (&lt;math&gt;20\times log_{10}(2)&lt;/math&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">A [[measurement]] system consists of a sensor, to input the physical parameter that is of interest, and an output to a medium that is suitable for reading by the system that needs to know the value of the parameter. (This could be a device to convert the temperature of the surrounding air or water into the visually readable height of a column of mercury in a small tube, for example; but the conversion could also be made to an electronic encoding of the parameter, for reading by a computer system.)

The '''integral linearity''' is then a measure of the fidelity of the conversion that is performed by the measuring system. It is the relation of the output to the input over a range expressed as a percentage of the full scale measurements.  Integral linearity is a measure of the device's deviation from an ideal behaviour.

The most common denotion of integral linearity is independent linearity.

In the context of a [[Digital-to-analog convertor]] (DAC) or an [[Analog-to-digital convertor]] (ADC), independent linearity is fitted to minimize the deviation with respect to the ideal behaviour with no constraints. Other types of integral linearity place constraints on the symmetry or end points of the linear fit with respect to the actual data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A practical electrical power source which is a linear electric circuit may, according to [[Thévenin's theorem]], be represented as an [[ideal voltage source]] in series with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].  This resistance is termed the '''internal resistance''' of the source. When the power source delivers [[Electric current|current]], the measured [[Electromotive force|e.m.f.]] (voltage output) is lower than the no-[[electrical load|load]] voltage; the difference is the voltage (the [[Ohm's law|product of current and resistance]]) drop caused by the internal resistance. The concept of internal resistance applies to all kinds of electrical sources and is useful for analyzing many types of electrical circuits. Internal resistance can be caused by a number of outcomes, though a possible cause is by interior chemical installment. When thermal energy is applied to provide the current, that applied energy is most of the power source's energy which produces the chemicals. The load current is delivered in a lap and returns to the battery (voltage source) and then performs resistance. 

== Batteries ==
[[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] can be approximately modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. The internal resistance of a battery is dependent on the specific battery's size, chemical properties, age, temperature and the discharge current. It has an electronic component due to the resistivity of the battery's component materials and an ionic component due to electrochemical factors such as electrolyte conductivity, ion mobility, and electrode surface area. Measurement of the internal resistance of a battery is a guide to its condition, but may not apply at other than the test conditions. Measurement with an [[alternating current]], typically at a frequency of 1kHz, may underestimate the resistance, as the frequency may be too high to take into account the slower electrochemical processes. Internal resistance depends upon temperature; for example, a fresh [[Energizer]] [[AA battery|E91 AA]] alkaline primary battery drops from about 0.9 ohms at -40 °C, where the low temperature reduces ion mobility, to about 0.15 ohms at room temperature and about 0.1 ohms at 40 °C.&lt;ref name=energizer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/BatteryIR.pdf|work=Energizer Technical Bulletin|publisher=[[Energizer Battery]]|title=Battery Internal Resistance|date=200512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal resistance of a battery can be calculated from its open circuit voltage, voltage on-load, and the load resistance:
 &lt;math&gt; R_{\text{int}} = ({\frac{ V_{\text{NL}} } { V_{\text{FL}} }  - 1 } ) { R_{\text{L}} }   &lt;/math&gt;

Many [[ESR meter|equivalent series resistance (ESR) meters]], essentially AC milliohmmeters normally used to measure the ESR of capacitors, can be used to estimate battery internal resistance, particularly to check the state of discharge of a battery rather than obtain an accurate dc value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flippers.com/esrkthnt.html#battery Testing batteries with ESR meter]&lt;/ref&gt; Some chargers for rechargeable batteries indicate the ESR.

In use the voltage across the terminals of a disposable battery driving a load decreases until it drops too low to be useful; this is largely due to an increase in internal resistance rather than a drop in the voltage of the equivalent source.

With rechargeable [[lithium polymer]] batteries the internal resistance is largely independent of the state of charge, but increases as the battery ages, thus is a good indicator of expected life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rchelicopterfun.com/rc-lipo-batteries.html Understanding RC LiPo Batteries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressiverc.com/media/ESR%20Meter%20Instructions.pdf ESR Meter For 2 – 6 Cell Lipo Packs - instructions]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skin depth.svg|thumb|Distribution of current flow in a cylindrical conductor, shown in cross section.  For [[alternating current]], most (63%) of the electrical current flows between the surface and the skin depth, δ, which depends on the frequency of the current and the electrical and magnetic properties of the conductor.]]

'''Skin effect''' is the tendency of an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] (AC) to become distributed within a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] such that the [[current density]] is largest near the surface of the conductor, and decreases with greater depths in the conductor. The electric current flows mainly at the &quot;skin&quot; of the conductor, between the outer surface and a level called the '''skin depth'''. The skin effect causes the effective [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor to increase at higher [[Frequency|frequencies]] where the skin depth is smaller, thus reducing the effective cross-section of the conductor. The skin effect is due to opposing [[eddy current]]s induced by the changing [[magnetic]] field resulting from the alternating current. At 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] in copper, the skin depth is about 8.5&amp;nbsp;mm. At high frequencies the skin depth becomes much smaller. Increased AC resistance due to the skin effect can be mitigated by using specially woven [[litz wire]]. Because the interior of a large conductor carries so little of the current, tubular conductors such as pipe can be used to save weight and cost.

== Cause ==
[[Image:Skineffect reason.svg|thumb|right|Skin depth is due to the circulating [[eddy current]]s (arising from a changing H field) cancelling the current flow in the center of a conductor and reinforcing it in the skin.]]

Conductors, typically in the form of wires, may be used to transmit electrical energy or signals using an [[alternating current]] flowing through that conductor. The charge carriers constituting that current, usually [[electron]]s, are driven by an electric field due to the source of electrical energy. An alternating current in a conductor produces an alternating magnetic field in and around the conductor.  When the intensity of current in a conductor changes, the magnetic field also changes.  The change in the magnetic field, in turn, creates an electric field which opposes the change in current intensity.  This opposing electric field is called “[[counter-electromotive force]]” (back EMF).  The back EMF is strongest at the center of the conductor, and forces the conducting electrons to the outside of the conductor, as shown in the diagram on the right.

An alternating current may also be ''induced'' in a conductor due to an alternating magnetic field according to the law of [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. An [[electromagnetic wave]] impinging on a conductor will therefore generally produce such a current; this explains the reflection of electromagnetic waves from metals.

Regardless of the driving force, the [[current density]] is found to be greatest at the conductor's surface, with a reduced magnitude deeper in the conductor. That decline in current density is known as the ''skin effect'' and the ''skin depth'' is a measure of the depth at which the current density falls to [[E (mathematical constant)|1/e]] of its value near the surface.
Over 98% of the current will flow within a layer 4 times the skin depth from the surface. This behavior is distinct from that of [[direct current]] which usually will be distributed evenly over the cross-section of the wire.

The effect was first described in a paper by [[Horace Lamb]] in 1883 for the case of spherical conductors, and was generalised to conductors of any shape by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1885. The skin effect has practical consequences in the analysis and design of  [[radio]]-frequency and [[microwave]] circuits, transmission lines (or waveguides), and antennas. It is also important even at mains frequencies (50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz) in AC [[electric power transmission|electrical power transmission and distribution]] systems. Although the term &quot;skin effect&quot; is most often associated with applications involving transmission of electrical currents, the skin depth also describes the exponential decay of the electric and magnetic fields, as well as the density of induced currents, inside a bulk material when a plane wave impinges on it at normal incidence.

==Formula==
The AC [[current density]] ''J'' in a conductor [[exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] from its value at the surface ''J''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
according to the depth ''d'' from the surface, as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;J=J_\mathrm{S} \,e^{-{d/\delta }}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' is called the ''[[skin depth]]''.  The skin depth is thus defined as the depth below the surface of the conductor at which the current density has fallen to 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]] (about 0.37) of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. In normal cases it is well approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{{2\rho }\over{\omega\mu_r\mu_0}}&lt;/math&gt;.

where
: ρ = [[resistivity]] of the conductor
: ω = [[angular frequency]] of current = 2π &amp;times; frequency
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_r &lt;/math&gt; = relative [[magnetic permeability]] of the conductor
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_0 &lt;/math&gt; = the [[permeability of free space]]

A more general expression for skin depth which is more exact in the case of poor conductors (non-metals) at high frequencies is:&lt;ref name=&quot;VanderVorst41&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|VanderVorst|2006|pg=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Jordan|1968|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\delta= \left({1 \over \omega}\right) \left\lbrace \left( {{\mu\epsilon} \over 2}\right) \left[ \left(1+\left({1 \over {\rho\omega\epsilon}}\right)^2\right)^{1/2} -1\right]\right\rbrace^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \mu_r &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mu_0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r &lt;/math&gt; = relative [[permittivity]] of the material
: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt; = the [[permittivity of free space]]
: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the usual form for the skin effect, above, the effect of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; cancels out. This formula is valid away from strong atomic or molecular resonances (where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; would have a large imaginary part) and at frequencies which are much below both the material's [[plasma frequency]] (dependent on the density of free electrons in the material) and the reciprocal of the mean time between collisions involving the conduction electrons. In good conductors such as metals all of those conditions are ensured at least up to microwave frequencies, justifying this formula's validity. 

This formula can be rearranged as follows to reveal departures from the normal approximation:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta= \sqrt{{2\rho }\over{\omega\mu}}
\; \;  \sqrt{ \sqrt{1 + \left({\rho\omega\epsilon}\right)^2 }
+ \rho\omega\epsilon}  &lt;/math&gt;

At frequencies much below &lt;math&gt;1/\rho \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; the quantity inside the radical is close to unity and the standard formula applies. For instance, in the case of copper this would be true for frequencies much below 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz.

However in very poor conductors at sufficiently high frequencies,
the factor on the right increases. At frequencies much higher than  &lt;math&gt;1/\rho \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; it can be shown that the skin depth, rather than continuing to decrease, approaches an asymptotic value:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta \approx  {2 \rho} \sqrt{\epsilon \over \mu} &lt;/math&gt;

This departure from the usual formula only applies for materials of rather low conductivity and at frequencies where the vacuum wavelength is not much larger than the skin depth itself. For instance, bulk silicon (undoped) is a poor conductor and has a skin depth of about 40&amp;nbsp;meters at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz (&amp;lambda; = 3000&amp;nbsp;m). However as the frequency is increased well into the megahertz range, its skin depth never falls below the asymptotic value of 11 meters. The conclusion is that in poor solid conductors such as undoped silicon, the skin effect doesn't need to be taken into account in most practical situations: any current is equally distributed throughout the material's cross-section regardless of its frequency.

==Resistance==

The effective resistance due to a current confined near the surface of a large conductor (much thicker than ''δ'') can be solved as if the current flowed uniformly through a layer of thickness ''δ'' based on the DC resistivity of that material. We can therefore assume a cross-sectional area approximately equal to ''δ'' times the conductor's circumference.
Thus a long cylindrical conductor such as a wire, having a diameter ''D'' large compared to ''δ'', has a resistance ''approximately'' that of a hollow tube with wall thickness ''δ'' carrying direct current.  Using a material of resistivity &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;  we then find the AC resistance of a wire of length ''L'' to be:

: &lt;math&gt;R\approx  
{{L \rho} \over {\pi (D-\delta) \delta}}
\approx
{{L \rho} \over {\pi D \delta}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The final approximation above assumes &lt;math&gt;D \gg \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

A convenient formula (attributed to [[Frederick Terman|F.E. Terman]]) for the diameter ''D''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; of a wire of circular cross-section whose resistance will increase by 10% at frequency ''f'' is:

: &lt;math&gt;D_\mathrm{W} = {\frac{200~\mathrm{mm}}{\sqrt{f/\mathrm{Hz}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The increase in AC resistance described above is accurate only for an isolated wire.  For a wire close to other wires, e.g. in a [[cable]] or a coil, the ac resistance is also affected by [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], which often causes a much more severe increase in ac resistance.

== Material effect on skin depth ==

In a good conductor, skin depth varies as the inverse square root of the conductivity.  This means that better conductors have a reduced skin depth.  The overall resistance of the better conductor remains lower even with the reduced skin depth. However the better conductor will show a higher ratio between its AC and DC resistance, when compared with a conductor of higher resistivity. For example, at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, a [[American wire gauge|2000 MCM]] (1000 square millimetre) copper conductor has 23% more resistance than it does at DC.  The same size conductor in aluminum has only 10% more resistance with 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC than it does with DC.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 table 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skin depth also varies as the inverse square root of the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the conductor.  In the case of iron, its conductivity is about 1/7 that of copper.  However being [[ferromagnetic]] its permeability is about 10,000 times greater.  This reduces the skin depth for iron to about 1/38 that of copper, about 220 [[micrometre]]s at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  Iron wire is thus useless for A.C. power lines. The skin effect also reduces the effective thickness of [[lamination]]s in power transformers, increasing their losses.

Iron rods work well for [[Direct current|direct-current]] (DC) [[welding]] but it is impossible to use them at frequencies much higher than 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  At a few kilohertz, the welding rod will glow red hot as current flows through the greatly increased A.C. resistance resulting from the skin effect, with relatively little power remaining for the  [[Arc welding|arc]] itself.  Only [[non-magnetic]] rods can be used for high-frequency welding.

== Mitigation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Transformer]] --&gt;

A type of cable called [[litz wire]] (from the [[German language|German]] ''Litzendraht'', braided wire) is used to mitigate the skin effect for frequencies of a few kilohertz to about one megahertz.  It consists of a number of insulated wire strands woven together in a carefully designed pattern, so that the overall magnetic field acts equally on all the wires and causes the total current to be distributed equally among them. With the skin effect having little effect on each of the thin strands, the bundle does not suffer the same increase in AC resistance that a solid conductor of the same cross-sectional area would due to the skin effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Litz wire is often used in the windings of high-frequency [[transformer]]s to increase their efficiency by mitigating both skin effect and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]].
Large power transformers are wound with stranded conductors of similar construction to litz wire, but employing a larger cross-section corresponding to the larger skin depth at mains frequencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;cegb_1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Conductive threads composed of [[carbon nanotube]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309121941.htm |title=Spinning Carbon Nanotubes Spawns New Wireless Applications |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been demonstrated as conductors for antennas from medium wave to microwave frequencies. Unlike standard antenna conductors, the nanotubes are much smaller than the skin depth, allowing full utilization of the thread's cross-section resulting in an extremely light antenna.

High-voltage, high-current [[overhead power line]]s often use [[Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced|aluminum cable with a steel reinforcing core]]; the higher resistance of the steel core is of no consequence since it is located far below the skin depth where essentially no AC current flows.

In other applications where high currents (up to many thousands of amperes) flow, where practicable solid conductors are usually replaced by tubes, completely dispensing with the inner portion of the conductor where little current flows. This hardly affects the AC resistance but considerably reduces the weight of the conductor. The high strength but low weight of tubes substantially increases span capability. Hence tubular conductors are typical to electric power switchyards where the distance between supporting insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. However to avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high. 

In high current situations where conductors (round or flat busbar) may be between 5 and 50&amp;nbsp;mm thick the skin effect also occurs at sharp bends where the metal is compressed inside the bend and stretched outside the bend. The shorter path at the inner surface results in a lower resistance, which causes most of the current to be concentrated close to the inner bend surface. This will cause an increase in temperature rise in that region compared with the straight (unbent) area of the same conductor. A similar skin effect occurs at the corners of rectangular conductors (viewed in cross-section), where the magnetic field is more concentrated at the corners than in the sides. This results in superior performance (i.e. higher current with lower temperature rise) from wide thin conductors - e.g. &quot;ribbon&quot; conductors, where the effects from corners is effectively eliminated.

It follows that a transformer having a round core will be more efficient than an equivalent VA rated transformer having a square or rectangular core of the same material.

Solid or tubular conductors may also be [[silver]]-[[Electroplating|plated]] to take advantage of silver's higher conductivity. This technique is particularly used at [[VHF]] to [[microwave]] frequencies where the small skin depth requires only a very thin layer of silver, making the improvement in conductivity very cost effective. Silver or gold plating is similarly used on the surface of waveguides used for transmission of microwaves. This reduces attenuation of the propagating wave due to resistive losses affecting the accompanying eddy currents; the skin effect confines such eddy currents to a very thin surface layer of the waveguide structure. The skin effect itself isn't actually combatted in these cases, but the distribution of currents near the conductor's surface makes the use of precious metals (having a lower resistivity) practical. 

NOTE: The heat dependent manufacturing process for wire results in oxidation of the surface in the finished product. Therefore the conductivity of the skin is significantly less than the underlying unoxidised base metal. It is to be expected that unless the oxidised surface material is removed, some loss of performance from the theoretical model will occur.

== Examples ==

[[File:Skin depth by Zureks.png|thumb|350px|Skin depth vs. frequency for some materials, red vertical line denotes 50&amp;nbsp;Hz frequency:&lt;br/&gt;

]]

We can derive a practical formula for skin depth as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{{2\rho }\over{(2 \pi f) (\mu_0 \mu_r)}} \approx 503\,\sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\mu_r f}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\delta = &lt;/math&gt; the skin depth in metres
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_r = &lt;/math&gt; the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|relative permeability]] of the medium
: &lt;math&gt;\rho = &lt;/math&gt; the resistivity of the medium in Ω·m, also equal to the reciprocal of its conductivity: &lt;math&gt;\rho = 1/ \sigma  &lt;/math&gt; (for copper, ρ = {{val|1.68|e=-8|u=Ω·m}})
: &lt;math&gt;f = &lt;/math&gt; the frequency of the current in Hz

[[Gold]] is a good conductor with a resistivity of {{val|2.44|e=-8|u=Ω·m}} and is essentially nonmagnetic: &lt;math&gt;\mu_r = &lt;/math&gt; 1, so its skin depth at a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\delta = 503 \,\sqrt{\frac{2.44 \cdot 10^{-8}}{1 \cdot 50}}= 11.1\,\mathrm{mm} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Lead]], in contrast, is a relatively poor conductor (among metals) with a resistivity of {{val|2.2|e=-7|u=Ω·m}}, about 9 times that of gold. Its skin depth at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is likewise found to be about 33&amp;nbsp;mm, or
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9} = 3 &lt;/math&gt; times that of gold.

Highly magnetic materials have a reduced skin depth owing to their large permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; as was pointed out above for the case of iron, despite its poorer conductivity. A practical consequence is seen by users of [[induction cooker]]s, where some types of [[stainless steel]] cookware are unusable because they are not ferromagnetic.&lt;ref&gt;If the permeability is low, the skin depth is so large that the resistance encountered by eddy currents is too low to provide enough heat&lt;/ref&gt;  

At very high frequencies the skin depth for good conductors becomes tiny. For instance, the skin depths of some common metals at a frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;GHz (microwave region) are less than a [[micrometre|micrometer]]:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Conductor !! Skin depth ([[μm]])

|-
| Gold      || style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;| 0.79
|-
| Silver    || style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;| 0.64
|}

Thus at [[microwave]] frequencies, most of the current flows in an extremely thin region near the surface.  Ohmic losses of waveguides at microwave frequencies are therefore only dependent on the surface coating of the material. A layer of silver 3&amp;nbsp;[[μm]] thick evaporated on a piece of glass is thus an excellent conductor at such frequencies.

In copper, the skin depth can be seen to fall according to the square root of frequency:

In ''Engineering Electromagnetics'', Hayt points out that in a power station a [[busbar]] for [[alternating current]] at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz with a radius larger than one-third of an inch (8&amp;nbsp;mm) is a waste of copper, and in practice bus bars for heavy AC current are rarely more than half an inch (12&amp;nbsp;mm) thick except for mechanical reasons.

==Skin effect reduction of the self inductance of a conductor==

Refer to the diagram below showing the inner and outer conductors of a coaxial cable. Since the skin effect causes a current at high frequencies to flow mainly at the surface of a conductor, it can be seen that this will reduce the magnetic field ''inside'' the wire, that is, beneath the depth at which the bulk of the current flows. It can be shown that this will have a minor effect on the self-inductance of the wire itself; see Skilling&lt;ref name=&quot;Skilling157_159&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Skilling|1951|pp=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hayt&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayt434_439&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hayt|1981|pp=434–439}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a mathematical treatment of this phenomenon. 

Note that the inductance considered in this context refers to a bare conductor, not the inductance of a coil used as a circuit element. The inductance of a coil is dominated by the mutual inductance between the turns of the coil which increases its inductance according to the square of the number of turns. However when only a single wire is involved, then in addition to the &quot;external inductance&quot; involving magnetic fields outside of the wire (due to the total current in the wire) as seen in the white region of the figure below, there is also a much smaller component of &quot;internal inductance&quot; due to the magnetic field inside the wire itself, the green region in  figure B. In a single wire the internal inductance becomes of little significance when the wire is much much longer than its diameter. The presence of a second conductor in the case of a transmission line requires a different treatment as is discussed below.

Due to the skin effect, at high frequencies the internal inductance of a wire vanishes, as can be seen in the case of a telephone twisted pair, below. In normal cases the effect of internal inductance is ignored in the design of coils or calculating the properties of [[microstrip]]s.

===Inductance per length in a coaxial cable===

Let the dimensions ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' be the inner conductor radius, the shield (outer conductor) inside radius and the shield outer radius respectively, as seen in the crossection of figure A below.

[[Image:Coax and Skin Depth.svg|center|thumb|800px|Four stages of skin effect in a coax showing the effect on inductance. Diagrams show a cross-section of the coaxial cable. Color code: black=overall insulating sheath, tan=conductor, white=dielectric, green=current into the diagram, blue=current coming out of the diagram, dashed black lines with arrowheads=magnetic flux (B). The width of the dashed black lines is intended to show relative strength of the magnetic field integrated over the circumference at that radius. The four stages, ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are non-energized, low frequency, middle frequency and high frequency respectively. There are three regions that may contain induced magnetic fields: the center conductor, the dielectric and the outer conductor. In stage ''B'', current covers the conductors uniformly and there is a significant magnetic field in all three regions. As the frequency is increased and the skin effect takes hold (''C'' and ''D'') the magnetic field in the dielectric region is unchanged as it is proportional to the total current flowing in the center conductor. In ''C'', however, there is a reduced magnetic field in the deeper sections of the inner conductor and the outer sections of the shield (outer conductor). Thus there is less energy stored in the magnetic field given the same total current, corresponding to a reduced inductance. At an even higher frequency, ''D'', the skin depth is tiny: all current is confined to the surface of the conductors. The only magnetic field is in the regions between the conductors; only the &quot;external inductance&quot; remains.]]

For a given current, the total energy stored in the magnetic fields must be the same as the calculated electrical energy attributed to that current flowing through the inductance of the coax; that energy is proportional to the cable's measured inductance.

The magnetic field inside a coaxial cable can be divided into three regions, each of which will therefore contribute to the electrical inductance seen by a length of cable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayt434&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hayt|1981|p=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inductance  &lt;math&gt; L_\text{cen} \, &lt;/math&gt; is associated with the magnetic field in the region with radius &lt;math&gt; r &lt; a \, &lt;/math&gt;, the region inside the center conductor.  

The inductance  &lt;math&gt; L_\text{ext} \, &lt;/math&gt; is associated with the magnetic field in the region &lt;math&gt; a &lt; r &lt; b \, &lt;/math&gt;, the region between the two conductors (containing a dielectric, possibly air).  

The inductance  &lt;math&gt; L_\text{shd} \, &lt;/math&gt; is associated with the magnetic field in the region &lt;math&gt; b &lt; r &lt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;, the region inside the shield conductor.  

The net electrical inductance is due to all three contributions:

:&lt;math&gt; L_\text{total} = L_\text{cen} + L_\text{shd} + L_\text{ext}\, &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; L_\text{ext} \, &lt;/math&gt; is not changed by the skin effect and is given by the frequently cited formula for inductance ''L'' per length ''D'' of a coaxial cable: 

:&lt;math&gt; L/D = \frac{\mu_0}{2 \pi} \ln  \left( \frac {b}{a}  \right)   \, &lt;/math&gt;

At low frequencies, all three inductances are fully present so that &lt;math&gt; L_\text{DC} = L_\text{cen} + L_\text{shd} + L_\text{ext}\, &lt;/math&gt;.

At high frequencies, only the dielectric region has magnetic flux, so that  &lt;math&gt; L_\infty = L_\text{ext}\, &lt;/math&gt;.

Most discussions of coaxial transmission lines assume they will be used for radio frequencies, so equations are supplied corresponding only to the latter case.

As the skin effect increases, the currents are concentrated near the outside of the inner conductor (''r''=''a'') and the inside of the shield (''r''=''b''). Since there is essentially no current deeper in the inner conductor, there is no magnetic field beneath the surface of the inner conductor. Since the current in the inner conductor is balanced by the opposite current flowing on the inside of the outer conductor, there is no remaining magnetic field in the outer conductor itself where  &lt;math&gt; b &lt; r &lt; c \, &lt;/math&gt;. Only &lt;math&gt; L_\text{ext} &lt;/math&gt; contributes to the electrical inductance at these higher frequencies.

Although the geometry is different, a twisted pair used in telephone lines is similarly affected: at higher frequencies the inductance decreases by more than 20% as can be seen in the following table.

'''Signal-to-noise and distortion ratio''' ('''SINAD''') is a measure of the quality of a signal from a communications device, often defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SINAD} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal} + P_\mathrm{noise} + P_\mathrm{distortion}}{P_\mathrm{noise} + P_\mathrm{distortion}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the average power of the [[signal (electronics)|signal]], [[noise]] and [[distortion]] components. SINAD is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]] and is quoted alongside the receiver RF [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], to give a quantitative evaluation of the receiver sensitivity. Note that with this definition, unlike [[Signal-to-noise_ratio|SNR]], a SINAD reading can never be less than 1 (i.e. it is always positive when quoted in dB).

When calculating the distortion, it is common to exclude the [[DC bias|DC]] components.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/740 |title=Glossary of Frequently Used High-Speed Data Converter Terms |publisher=[[Maxim Integrated Products]] |date=2001-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to widespread use, SINAD has collected several different definitions. SINAD is commonly defined as:

#The ratio of (a) total received [[Power (physics)|power]], ''i.e.'', the signal to (b) the noise-plus-distortion power.  This is modeled by the equation above.{{cn|date=March 2012}}
#The ratio of (a) the power of original modulating audio signal, ''i.e.,'' from a modulated [[radio frequency]] [[carrier wave|carrier]] to (b) the residual audio power, ''i.e.,'' noise-plus-distortion powers remaining after the original modulating audio signal is removed. With this definition, it is possible to have a SINAD level less than one. This definition is used in the calculation of [[ENOB]] for an [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-003.pdf |title=Understand SINAD, ENOB, SNR, THD, THD + N, and SFDR so You Don't Get Lost in the Noise Floor |publisher=[[Analog Devices, Inc.]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the exact definition, it is always true that a lower SINAD value means worse performance of the system. As the received [[Radio frequency|RF]] signal becomes weaker it becomes progressively lost in the noise and distortion generated by receiver, demodulation and audio output drive circuits. By convention, the minimum acceptable SINAD level that will not swamp intelligible speech is 12dB for a narrow band [[Frequency modulation|FM]] voice radio system.{{cn|date=March 2012}}

==Commercial Radio Specifications==
A typical example, quoted from a commercial hand held [[VHF]] or [[UHF]] radio, might be:

:Receiver sensitivity: 0.25μV at 12dB SINAD

which is stating that the receiver will produce intelligible speech with a signal at its input as low as 0.25μV.  Radio receiver designers will test the product in a laboratory following a procedure.  A typical example procedure is as follows:

* With no signal present on the input, the noise and distortion of the receiver are measured at a convenient level
* A signal is applied to the input which causes the output to increase 12 dB
* The level of the signal needed to produce this is noted and is found to be 0.25 microVolts.

According to the radio designer, intelligible speech can be detected 12dB above the receiver's noise floor (noise and distortion).  Regardless on how accurate this output power is regarding intelligible speech, having a standard output SINAD allows for easy comparison between radio receiver input sensitivities.  This value is typical for VHF commercial radio while 0.35μV is probably more typical for UHF. In the real world lower SINAD values (more noise) can still result in intelligible speech but it is tiresome work to listen to a voice in that much noise.

SINADR is typically used in data converter specifications. SINADR is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SINADR} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{quantizationError} + P_\mathrm{randomNoise} + P_\mathrm{distortion}}
&lt;/math&gt;

SINADR is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. SINADR is a standard metric for [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]].

SINADR (in dB) is related to [[ENOB]] by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SINADR} = ENOB\cdot 6.02 + 1.76
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solid-state''' [[electronics]] are those circuits or devices built entirely from solid materials and in which the [[electron]]s, or other [[charge carrier]]s, are confined entirely within the solid material.&lt;ref&gt;Martin H. Weik, ''Fiber optics standard dictionary'', p.937, Birkhäuser, 1997 ISBN 0-412-12241-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used to contrast with the earlier technologies of [[vacuum tube|vacuum]] and [[gas-discharge tube]] devices and it is also conventional to exclude electro-mechanical devices ([[relay]]s, [[Switchgear|switches]], [[hard drive]]s and other devices with [[moving parts]]) from the term solid state.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence J. Kamm, ''Understanding electro-mechanical engineering'',p.174, John Wiley and Sons, 1995 ISBN 0-7803-1031-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrie Soloman, ''Sensors handbook'', page 23.18, McGraw-Hill Professional, 1998 ISBN 0-07-059630-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  While solid-state can include [[crystalline]], [[polycrystalline]] and [[amorphous]] solids and refer to [[electrical conductor]]s, [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]]s and [[semiconductor]]s, the building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.&lt;ref&gt;John Sydney Blakemore, ''Solid state physics'', pp.1-3, Cambridge University Press, 1985 ISBN 0-521-31391-0.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Jaeger, Travis N. Blalock, ''Microelectronic circuit design'', pp.46-47, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003 ISBN 0-07-250503-6.&lt;/ref&gt;   Common solid-state devices include [[transistor]]s, [[microprocessor]] chips, and [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. A specialized type of RAM called [[flash memory|flash RAM]] is used in [[flash drives]] and, more recently, [[solid state drives]] to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc [[hard drives]]. A considerable amount of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] action takes place within the device. The expression became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from [[vacuum tube]] technology to semiconductor [[diode]]s and [[transistor]]s. More recently, the [[integrated circuit]] (IC), the [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), and the [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) have evolved as further examples of solid-state devices.

In a solid-state component, the [[Electric current|current]] is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged [[electron]]s, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called [[electron hole|hole]]s.

The first solid-state device was the &quot;[[cat's whisker]]&quot; detector, first used in 1930s radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a [[germanium]] crystal) in order to detect a [[radio]] signal by the contact junction effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/solid+state &quot;Solid state&quot;], ''The Free Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the [[transistor]] in 1947.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the creation of [[alternating current]] (AC) [[waveform]]s; most commonly to drive [[3 phase]] AC powered motors at varying speeds from DC using multiple [[Switching amplifier|class-D amplifiers]]. There are various variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.

[[File:Three leg inverter.gif|240px|thumb|right|Topology of a basic three phase inverter.]]

A three phase inverter as shown to the right converts a DC supply, via a series of switches, to three output legs which could be connected to a three-phase motor.

The switches must be controlled so that at no time are both switches in the same leg turned on or else the DC supply would be shorted. This requirement may be met by the complementary operation of the switches within a leg. i.e. if A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is on then A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is off and vice versa. This leads to eight possible switching vectors for the inverter, V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through V&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; with six active switching vectors and two zero vectors.

Note that looking down the columns for the active switching vectors V&lt;sub&gt;1-6&lt;/sub&gt;, the output voltages vary as a pulsed sinusoid, with each leg offset by 120 degrees of [[Phasor_(electronics)|phase angle]].

To implement space vector modulation, a reference signal V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is sampled with a frequency f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;). The reference signal may be generated from three separate phase references using the [[Alpha beta gamma transform|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform]]. The reference vector is then synthesized using a combination of the two adjacent active switching vectors and one or both of the zero vectors. Various strategies of selecting the order of the vectors and which zero vector(s) to use exist. Strategy selection will affect the harmonic content and the switching losses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12009">:''The term '''damping factor''' can also refer to the [[damping ratio]] in any [[Damping|damped]] oscillatory system or in [[Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm#Choice of damping parameter|numerical algorithms.]]

In an [[audio system]], the '''damping factor''' gives the ratio of the rated impedance of the loudspeaker to the source impedance. Only the resistive part of the loudspeaker impedance is used. The amplifier output impedance is also assumed to be totally resistive. The source impedance (that seen by the loudspeaker) includes the connecting cable impedance. 
The [[load impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{load}&lt;/math&gt; (input impedance) and the [[source impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{source}&lt;/math&gt; (output impedance) are shown in the diagram.

[[Image:Source and load circuit Z.png]]

The damping factor &lt;math&gt;DF&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;
DF = \frac{Z_\mathrm{load}}{Z_\mathrm{source}} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{source}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
Z_\mathrm{source} = \frac{Z_\mathrm{load}}{DF} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

== Explanation ==
In [[loudspeaker]] systems, the value of the damping factor between a particular loudspeaker and a particular [[amplifier]] describes the ability of the amplifier [[control system|to control]] undesirable movement of the speaker cone near the [[resonant frequency]] of the speaker system. It is usually used in the context of low-frequency driver behavior, and especially so in the case of electrodynamic drivers, which use a magnetic [[electric motor|motor]] to generate the forces which move the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]].

Speaker diaphragms have [[mass]], and their surroundings have [[stiffness]]. Together, these form a [[resonant]] system, and the mechanical cone resonance may be excited by electrical signals (e.g., [[pulse]]s) at audio frequencies. But a driver with a [[voice coil]] is also a current generator, since it has a coil attached to the cone and suspension, and that coil is immersed in a magnetic field. For every motion the coil makes, it will generate a current that will be seen by any electrically attached equipment, such as an amplifier. In fact, the amp's output circuitry will be the main electrical load on the &quot;voice coil current generator&quot;. If that load has low resistance, the current will be larger and the voice coil will be more strongly forced to decelerate. A high damping factor (which requires low output impedance at the amplifier output) very rapidly damps unwanted cone movements induced by the mechanical resonance of the speaker, acting as the equivalent of a &quot;brake&quot; on the voice coil motion (just as a short circuit across the terminals of a rotary electrical generator will make it very hard to turn). It is generally (though not universally) thought that tighter control of voice coil motion is desirable, as it is believed to contribute to better-quality sound.

A high damping factor indicates that an amplifier will have greater control over the movement of the speaker cone, particularly in the bass region near the resonant frequency of the driver's mechanical resonance. However, the damping factor at any particular frequency will vary, since driver voice coils are complex impedances whose values vary with frequency. In addition, the electrical characteristics of every voice coil will change with temperature; high power levels will increase coil temperature, and thus resistance. And finally, passive crossovers (made of relatively large inductors, capacitors, and resistors) are between the amplifier and speaker drivers and also affect the damping factor, again in a way that varies with frequency.

For [[Sound|audio]] power [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]]s, this source impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{source}&lt;/math&gt; (also: [[output impedance]]) is generally smaller than 0.1 ohm (Ω), and from the point of view of the driver voice coil, is a near short-circuit.

The loudspeaker's [[load impedance]] (input impedance) of &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{load}&lt;/math&gt; is usually around 4 to 8Ω, although other impedance speakers are available, sometimes as low as 1Ω.

== The damping circuit ==
The voltage generated by the moving voice coil forces current through three resistances:
*the resistance of the voice coil itself;
*the resistance of the interconnecting cable; and
*the output resistance of the amplifier.

=== Effect of voice coil resistance ===

This is the major factor in limiting the amount of damping that can be achieved electrically, because its value is larger (say between 4 and 8 Ω, typically) than any other resistance in the output circuitry of an amplifier that does not use an output transformer (nearly every solid-state amplifier on the mass market).

A loud speaker's flyback current is not dissipated only through the amplifier output circuit, but also through the internal resistance in the speaker itself.

Even if the resistance of the speaker cable and of the amplifier is 0 Ω, the speaker still faces the resistance of its own voice coil wire.

Therefore, damping factor values above 50 or so are not meaningfully different from 50.  For higher values of speaker damping than about 50, actual speaker damping no longer increases in any way that can be confirmed by a double-blind A/B listening test, or measured.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Effect of cable resistance ===
The damping factor is affected to some extent by the resistance of the speaker cables. The higher the resistance of the speaker cables, the lower the damping factor. When the effect is small, it is called voltage [[impedance bridging|bridging]]. &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{load}&lt;/math&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{source}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;!-- yes, and the connection with speaker cables and their effect on damping factor is? --&gt;

=== Amplifier output impedance ===
Modern solid state amplifiers, which use relatively high levels of [[negative feedback]] to control distortion, have extremely low output impedances—one of the many consequences of using feedback—and small changes in an already low value change overall damping factor by only a small, and therefore negligible, amount.

Thus, high damping factor values do not, by themselves, say very much about the quality of a system; most modern amplifiers have them, but vary in quality nonetheless. Given the controversy that has long surrounded the use of feedback,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} some{{who|date=September 2012}} extend their distaste for negative feedback (NFB) amplifier designs (and so a high damping factor) as a mark of poor quality. For them, such high values imply a high level of NFB in the amplifier.

[[Vacuum tube|Tube]] amplifiers typically have much lower feedback ratios, and in any case almost always have output transformers that limit how low the output impedance can be. Their lower damping factors are one of the reasons many audiophiles prefer tube amplifiers. Taken even further, some tube amplifiers are designed to have no NFB at all.

== In practice ==

Over a range from less than 1 to up to around 50, damping factor describes the ability to which the amplifier helps to control the oscillation of the speaker, expressing the degree to which the amplifier does not exert a resistance against the current generated by the speaker. A damping factor of 50 is high, indicating that the output impedance of the amplifier is negligible compared to the internal resistance of the speaker and the speaker cabling.

Higher electrical damping of the loudspeaker is not necessarily better.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} Some loudspeakers sound better with lower electrical damping.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A lower damping factor helps to greatly enhance the bass response of the loudspeaker, which is useful if only a single amplifier is used for the entire audio range. Therefore, some amplifiers, in particular vintage amplifiers from the 1950s, 60's and 70's, feature controls for varying the damping factor.

One example of a vintage amplifier with a damping control is the Accuphase E-202, which has a three-position switch described by the following excerpt from its owner's manual:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuphase.com/cat/e-202en.pdf |title=Accuphase E-202 Integrated Stereo Amplifier |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Speaker Damping Control enhances characteristic tonal qualities of speakers. The damping factor of solid state amplifiers is generally very large and ideal for damping the speakers. However, some speakers require an amplifier with a low damping factor to reproduce rich, full-bodied sound. The E-202 has a Speaker Damping Control which permits choice of three damping factors and induces maximum potential performance from any speaker. Damping factor with an 8 ohm load becomes more than 50 when this control is set to NORMAL. Likewise, it is 5 at MEDIUM position, and 1 at SOFT position. It enables choosing the speaker sound that one prefers.&quot;

By contrast, in modern high fidelity amplification, the trend is to separate the bass signal and amplify it with a dedicated amplifier. Often, amplifiers for bass are integrated with the speaker cabinet, a configuration known as the powered subwoofer. In a topology that includes a dedicated amplifier for bass, the damping factor of the main amplifier is not relevant, and that of the bass amplifier is also irrelevant if that amplifier is integrated with the speaker and cabinet as a unit, since all those components are designed together and optimized for the reproduction of bass.

Damping is also a concern in guitar amplifiers (an application in which distortion is desirable) and low damping can be better. Numerous guitar amplifiers have damping controls, and the trend to include this feature has been increasing since the 1990s. For instance the Marshall Valvestate 8008 rack-mounted stereo amplifier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marshallamps.com/downloads/files/8004_8008%20hbk.pdf  |title=Marshall Valvestate Power Amplifiers Handbook |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a switch between &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;Valvestate&quot; mode:
:&quot;Linear/Vstate selector.  Slide to select linear or Valvestate performance. The Valvestate mode gives extra warm harmonics plus the richness of tone, which is unique to the Valvestate power stage. Linear mode produces a highly defined hi-fi tone that gives a totally different character to the sound and suits certain modern &quot;metal&quot; styles, or PA applications.&quot;
This is actually a damping control based on negative current feedback, which is evident from the schematic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drtube.com/schematics/marshall/8008.pdf  |title=Marshall 8008 Valvestate Schematic |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the same switch is labeled as &quot;Output Power Mode: Current/Voltage&quot;. The &quot;Valvestate&quot; mode introduces negative current feedback which raises the output impedance, lowers the damping factor, and alters the frequency response, similarly to what occurs in a tube amplifier. (Contrary to the claim in the handbook, this circuit topology has appeared in numerous solid-state guitar amplifiers since the 1970s.)

'''Data-dependent jitter''' ('''DDJ''') is a specific class of timing [[jitter]]. In particular, it is a form of [[deterministic jitter]] which is correlated with the sequence of bits in the data stream. It is also a form of [[Intersymbol interference|ISI]].

==Properties==
Depending on characteristics of the [[Analog signal|signal]] and [[Transmission line|transmission]] topology, previously transmitted symbols can affect the edge cross over time. This creates a [[probability distribution]] for the timing of the signal edge, which is usually recorded in a [[Probability density function|PDF]].

DDJ's [[Probability density function|PDF]] is always a series of [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulses]] at the locations where a specific bit pattern experiences a [[Crossover distortion|cross over]]. Therefore, in order to get an accurate measure of the DDJ in a particular system, a large number of bit patterns must be analyzed (often just a [[PRBS]]) unless an [[analytical solution]] can be found.

A '''daughterboard''', '''daughtercard''', '''mezzanine board''' or '''piggyback board''' is a [[circuit board]] meant to be an extension or &quot;daughter&quot; of a [[motherboard]] (or 'mainboard'), or occasionally of another card.  In particular, daughterboards often have [[plugs (connector)|plugs]], [[Jack (connector)|sockets]], [[pins]], [[electrical connector|connectors]], or other attachments for other boards, which is what differentiates them from standard expansion boards such as for [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]], which are usually called [[expansion card]]s.  In addition, daughterboards usually have only internal [[Electrical connector|connections]] within a [[computer]] or other [[electronics|electronic]] [[machine|devices]] rather than any external ones, and usually access the motherboard directly rather than through a [[computer bus]].

Daughterboards are sometimes used in computers in order to allow for expansion cards to fit on their side (or upright), [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the motherboard, usually to maintain a small or slim [[Computer form factor|form factor]]. In this case they can also be called [[riser card]]s, or risers. Daughterboards are also sometimes used to expand the basic functionality of an electronic device, such as when a certain model has features added to it and is released as a new or separate model.  Rather than redesign the first model completely, a daughterboard may be added to a special [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] or connector on the motherboard or mainboard.  These usually fit on top of and parallel to the board, separated by [[spacer]]s or [[Standoff (separator)|standoff]]s, and are therefore sometimes called '''mezzanine cards''' due to being stacked like the [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] of a [[theatre]]. [[Wavetable]] cards are often [[wikt:mount|mounted]] on [[sound card]]s in this manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5735">{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}
When describing a [[periodic function]] in the [[frequency domain]], the '''DC bias''', '''DC component''', '''DC offset''', or '''DC coefficient''' is the [[mean]] value of the [[waveform]]. If the mean amplitude is zero, there is no DC offset. In contrast, various other frequencies are analogous to superimposed [[alternating current|AC]] voltages or currents, hence called '''AC components''' or '''AC coefficients'''.

The term originated in electronics, where it refers to a [[direct current]] voltage, but the concept has been extended to any representation of a [[waveform]]. The term's use is extended to two-dimensional transformations like the [[discrete cosine transform]] used in [[JPEG]].

A waveform without a DC component is known as a '''DC-balanced''' waveform. DC-balanced waveforms are useful in communications systems to avoid voltage imbalance problems between connected systems or components.

DC offset is usually undesirable when it causes saturation or change in the operating point of an amplifier. An electrical DC bias will not pass through a [[transformer]]; thus a simple [[isolation transformer]] can be used to block or remove it, leaving only the AC component on the other side. In signal processing terms, DC offset can be reduced in real-time by a [[high-pass filter]]. When one already has the entire waveform, subtracting the mean amplitude from each sample will remove the offset.  Often, very low frequencies are called &quot;slowly changing DC&quot; or &quot;baseline wander&quot;.

==Practical applications==
A DC [[tape bias]] was used in early tape recorders to reduce distortion.

A DC bias is applied to the control grid of [[vacuum tube]]s in [[power amplifier]]s in order to regulate power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randall Aiken |url=http://www.aikenamps.com/WhatIsBiasing.htm |title=What Is Biasing? |publisher=Aikenamps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DC-balanced signals are used in communications systems to prevent bit errors when passing through circuits with [[Capacitive coupling]] or [[transformer]]s. Bit errors can occur when a series of 1's create a DC level that charges the capacitor of the high-pass filter used as the AC coupler, bringing the signal input down incorrectly to a 0-level. In order to avoid these kinds of bit errors, most [[line code]]s are designed to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC balanced line codes are [[constant-weight code]]s and [[paired-disparity code]]s.

===Audio Recording===

In audio recording, a DC offset is an undesirable characteristic of a recording sound. It occurs in the capturing of sound, before it reaches the recorder, and is normally caused by defective or low-quality equipment. The offset causes the center of the recording waveform to not be at 0, but at a higher value, for example, +1. This can cause two main problems. Either the loudest parts of the signal will be clipped prematurely, since the base of the waveform has been moved up, or inaudible low-frequency distortion will occur. Low-frequency distortion may not be audible in the initial recording, but if the waveform is resampled to a compressed or lossy digital format, such as an MP3, those corruptions may become audible.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/DC_offset&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote power===
{{main|Phantom power}}
A DC bias can be used to power microphones or other devices over the same wires as required for the signal. This is commonly used, for example, in professional audio [[microphone]]s. 

On modern [[satellite dish]]es, used for [[direct broadcast satellite|direct-broadcast]] [[satellite TV]], a DC bias is used to provide [[electrical power]] to the [[feedhorn]].  Changing the bias between approximately 12 and 18 volts also allows selection of the correct [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] (horizontal and vertical on older systems, [[clockwise]] and counterclockwise on newer [[circular polarization]] systems).

===Frequency selection===
On a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO), such as in a [[radio transmitter]], selection of the [[center frequency]] of the [[carrier wave]] is done with a DC bias.  For [[frequency modulation]] (FM), the AC component is the [[baseband]] [[audio signal]] plus any [[subcarrier]]s.  [[Frequency-shift keying]] can be done solely by changing the DC bias.

===Electrical grid===
The [[electrical grid]], which is normally [[three-phase]] AC, can be severely disrupted by the presence of a large DC bias.  This is caused by strong [[solar flare]]s hitting the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]], which in turn creates strong [[electromagnetic field]]s.  This [[electromagnetic induction|induce]]s voltages in long-distance electrical lines, which can be strong enough to [[electrical arcing|arc]] across transformers.  (Even [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, such as the mostly above-ground [[Alaska Pipeline]], are prone to this, and must be tied to [[electrical ground]] with [[zinc]] [[sacrificial anode]]s.)  This is a rare but serious problem, mostly for far northern locations like [[Canada]] and [[Scandinavia]], where a strong [[aurora borealis]] will cover much lower [[latitude]]s than normal during such a situation.  [[Space weather]] [[weather forecast|forecast]]s are used to predict when these [[geomagnetic storm]] events might occur.  [[High-voltage direct current]] systems have their own control gear at [[electrical inverter|conversion]] stations and can adapt somewhat better to such conditions, however large and often widely-fluctuating voltages can still cause problems like [[harmonics]].

'''DC injection braking''' is a method of slowing [[AC motor|AC electric motors]]. A DC voltage is injected into the winding of the AC motor after the AC voltage is disconnected, providing braking force to the rotor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ralph L. | last=Jaeschke | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title=Controlling Power Transmission Systems | publisher=Penton/IPC | location=Cleveland, OH |pages=200–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of DC injection braking ==

When power is disconnected from the motor, the rotor spins freely until friction slows it to a stop. Large rotors and loads with a high [[moment of inertia]] may take a significant amount of time to stop through inherent friction alone. To reduce downtime, or possibly as an emergency safety feature, DC injection braking can be used to quickly stop the rotor.

A DC injection brake system can be used as an alternative to a friction brake system. DC injection brakes only require a small module located with the other motor switchgear and/or drivers, mounted in a remote and convenient location, whereas a friction brake must be mounted somewhere on the rotating system. Friction brakes eventually wear out with use and require replacement of braking components. DC brake modules do not have consumable parts and should not require maintenance. Friction brakes also require a method of actuation, requiring either a human operator or system controlled actuator, adding to the complexity of the system. A DC brake is easily integrated into the motor control circuitry.

A DC voltage is applied to the motor windings, creating a stationary magnetic field which applies a static torque to the rotor. This slows and eventually halts the rotor completely. As long as the DC voltage is applied to the windings, the rotor will be held in position and resistant to any attempt to spin it. The higher the voltage that is applied, the stronger the braking force and holding power.

In [[electronics]], '''decoupling''' is the prevention of undesired [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]] between subsystems.

A common example is connecting localized [[capacitor]]s close to the power leads of [[integrated circuit]]s to suppress coupling via the [[power supply]] connections.  These act as a small localized energy reservoir that supply the circuit with current during [[transient (oscillation)|transient]], high current demand periods, preventing the voltage on the power supply rail from being pulled down by the momentary current load. Another common example of the use of [[decoupling capacitor]]s is across the emitter [[biasing|bias]] resistor of transistor [[common emitter]] amplifiers to prevent the resistor absorbing a portion of the [[alternating current|AC]] output power of the amplifier.

Lossy ferrite beads may also be used to isolate or 'island' sections of circuitry. These add a high series impedance (in contrast to the low parallel impedance added by decoupling capacitors) to the power supply rails, preventing high-frequency currents being drawn from elsewhere in the system.

A '''decoupling capacitor''' is a [[capacitor]] used to [[Decoupling_(electronics)|decouple]] one part of an [[electrical network]] (circuit) from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect it has on the rest of the circuit.

For example, if the voltage level for a device is fixed, changing power demands are manifested as changing current demand. The power supply must accommodate these variations in current draw with as little change as possible in the power supply voltage. When the current draw in a device changes, the power supply cannot respond to that change instantaneously. As a consequence, the voltage at the device changes for a brief period before the power supply responds. The [[voltage regulator]] adjusts the amount of current it is supplying to keep the output voltage constant but can only effectively maintain the output voltage for events at frequencies from DC to a few hundred kHz, depending on the regulator (some are effective at regulating in the low MHz). For [[Transient (oscillation)|transient events]] that occur at frequencies above this range, there is a time lag before the voltage regulator responds to the new current demand level.

This is where the decoupling capacitor comes in. The decoupling capacitor works as the device’s local [[Electric field|energy storage]]. The capacitor cannot provide DC power because it stores only a small amount of energy but this energy can respond very quickly to changing current demands. The capacitors effectively maintain power-supply voltage at [[Frequency response|frequencies]] from hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz (in the milliseconds to nanoseconds range). Decoupling capacitors are not useful for events occurring above or below this range.

An alternative name is '''bypass capacitor''' as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit.

==Decoupling==
One common kind of decoupling is of a powered circuit from signals in the [[power supply]]. Sometimes, for various reasons, a power supply supplies an [[Alternating current|AC]] signal superimposed on the [[Direct current|DC]] power line. Such a signal is often undesirable in the powered circuit. A decoupling capacitor can prevent the powered circuit from seeing that signal, thus decoupling it from that aspect of the power supply circuit.

Another kind of decoupling is stopping a portion of a circuit from being affected by switching that happens in another portion. Switching in subcircuit A may cause fluctuations in the power supply or other electrical lines, but you do not want subcircuit B, which has nothing to do with that switching, to be affected. A decoupling capacitor can decouple subcircuits A and B so that B doesn't see any effects of the switching.

To decouple a subcircuit from AC signals or [[voltage spike]]s on a power supply or other line, a bypass capacitor is often used. A bypass capacitor is to [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] energy from those signals or transients past the subcircuit to be decoupled, right to the return path.  For a power supply line, a bypass capacitor from the supply voltage line to the power supply return (neutral) would be used.

High frequencies and transient currents flow through a capacitor, in this case in preference to the harder path through the decoupled circuit, but DC cannot go through the capacitor, so continues on to the decoupled circuit.

==Switching subcircuits==
In a switching subcircuit switching noise must be suppressed. When a load is applied to a voltage source, it draws a certain amount of current. Typical power supply lines show inherent [[inductance]], which results in a slower response to change in current. This in turn affects the transient voltage levels, since if the load current is zero the voltage across the load is zero as well. This sudden voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output capacitors of the power supply. This is only temporary; the inductor ultimately saturates (that is the magnetic field around the conductor reaches its max), the voltage drop across the inductor reaches zero, and the supply voltage comes back to normal. But even a temporary reduction in voltage can disturb adjacent subcircuits. Decoupling caps provide instantenous current jolt which helps maintain constant voltage across a subcircuit (or provide a low impedance path for the transient currents; different descriptions are used by different industries).

To decouple other subcircuits from the effect of the sudden current demand, a decoupling capacitor can be placed between the supply voltage line and its reference (ground) next to the switched load. While the load is switched out, the capacitor charges up to full power supply voltage and otherwise does nothing. When the load is applied, the capacitor initially supplies demanded current. Ideally, by the time the capacitor runs out of charge, the power supply line inductance is saturated, and the load can draw full current at normal voltage from the power supply (and the capacitor can recharge too). Note that the voltage dip is reduced but not eliminated; i.e., the decoupling is not perfect and sometimes parallel combinations of caps are used to improve response. The best way to reduce switching noise is to design a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] as a giant capacitor by sandwiching the power and ground planes across a [[dielectric]] material.

The size of the capacitor must be reasonable, and there is a tradeoff between capacitor size and signal quality at a given frequency. If a cap is too large it would distort the signal by charging too slowly and filtering out the signal's most needed high-frequency components.

==Transient load decoupling==

[[Transient (oscillation)|Transient]] [[Electrical load|load]] decoupling as described above is needed when there is a large load that gets switched quickly. The parasitic inductance in every (decoupling) capacitor may limit the suitable capacity and influence appropriate type if switching occurs very fast.

[[Logic]] circuits tend to do sudden switching (an ideal logic circuit would switch from low voltage to high voltage instantaneously, with no middle voltage ever observable). So logic circuit boards often have a decoupling capacitor close to each logic IC connected from each power supply connection to a nearby ground. These capacitors decouple every IC from every other IC in terms of supply voltage dips. 

These capacitors are often placed at each power source as well as at each analog component in order to ensure that the supplies are as steady as possible. Otherwise, an analog component with poor [[power supply rejection ratio|power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)]] will copy fluctuations in the power supply onto its output. 

In these applications, the decoupling capacitors are often called ''bypass capacitors'' to indicate that they provide an alternate path for high-frequency signals that would otherwise cause the normally steady supplies to move. Those components that require quick injections of current can ''bypass'' the power supply by receiving the current from the nearby capacitor. Hence, the slower power supply connection is used to charge these capacitors, and the capacitors actually provide the large quantities of high-availability current.

==Placement==
A transient load decoupling capacitor should usually be placed as close as possible to the device requiring the decoupled signal. The goal is to minimize the amount of line [[inductance]] and series [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] between the decoupling capacitor and that device, and the longer the conductor between the capacitor and the device, the more inductance there is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Capacitors.html Capacitor Design Data, and Decoupling Placement, How-to] on [http://www.interfacebus.com/ Leroy's Engineering Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines for placing a high-speed decoupling capacitor on a multi-layer printed circuit board depend on whether the board has dedicated power distribution planes and how closely spaced those planes are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnemc.com/tutorials/Decoupling_index.html LearnEMC Circuit Board Decoupling Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since capacitors differ in their high-frequency characteristics (and capacitors with good high-frequency properties are often types with small capacity, while large capacitors usually have worse high-frequency response), decoupling often involves the use of a ''combination'' of capacitors. For example in logic circuits, a common arrangement is ~100 nF ceramic per logic IC (multiple ones for complex ICs), combined with electrolytic or tantalum capacitor(s) up to a few hundred μF per board / board section.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

'''Jitter''' is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] in [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], often in relation to a reference [[clock signal|clock source]].  Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the [[frequency]] of successive pulses, the signal [[amplitude]], or [[phase (waves)|phase]] of periodic signals.  Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., [[USB]], [[PCI-e]], [[SATA]], [[OC-48]]).  In [[clock recovery]] applications it is called ''timing jitter''.&lt;ref name=wol91p211&gt;[[#Wol1991|Wolaver, 1991, p.211]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals, e.g., [[root mean square|RMS]], or peak-to-peak displacement.  Also like other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral density (frequency content).

''Jitter period'' is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with time.  ''Jitter frequency'', the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse. [[ITU-T G.810]] classifies jitter frequencies below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz as '''wander''' and frequencies at or above 10&amp;nbsp;Hz  as jitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.exfo.com/appnotes/anote119-ang.pdf |title=Application note 119 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk with carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers, introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.

==Sampling jitter==
In analog to digital and  digital to analog conversion of signals, the sampling is normally assumed to be periodic with a fixed period—the time between every two samples is the same. If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the [[analog-to-digital converter]] or a [[digital-to-analog converter]], the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error is proportional to the [[slew rate]] of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error.  Various effects such as noise (random jitter), or spectral components (periodic jitter){{Specify|date=September 2010}} can come about depending on the pattern of the jitter in relation to the signal.  In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a [[Nyquist frequency]] of 22&amp;nbsp;kHz to 14 bits.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This is a consideration in high-frequency signal conversion, or where the clock signal is especially prone to interference.

==Packet jitter in computer networks==
{{Main|Packet delay variation}}
In the context of computer networks, jitter is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the packet latency across a network. A network with constant latency has no variation (or jitter).&lt;ref name=&quot;Comer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Comer|first=Douglas E. |title=Computer Networks and Internets|publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |page=476 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tm-evHmOs3oC&amp;pg=PA476 | isbn=978-0-13-606127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean latency. However, for this use, the term is imprecise. The standards-based term is &quot;[[packet delay variation]]&quot; (PDV).&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3393, ''IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)'', IETF (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; PDV is an important [[quality of service]] factor in assessment of network performance.

==Compact disc seek jitter==
In the context of [[ripping|digital audio extraction]] from [[Compact Disc]]s, '''seek jitter''' causes extracted [[Sampling (signal processing)|audio samples]] to be doubled-up or skipped entirely if the Compact Disc drive re-seeks. The problem occurs because the [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] does not require block-accurate addressing during seeking. As a result, the extraction process may restart a few samples early or late, resulting in doubled or omitted samples. These glitches often sound like tiny repeating clicks during playback. A successful approach to correction in software involves performing overlapping reads and fitting the data to find overlaps at the edges. Most extraction programs perform seek jitter correction.  CD manufacturers avoid seek jitter by extracting the entire disc in one continuous read operation, using special CD drive models at slower speeds so the drive does not re-seek.

A jitter meter is a testing instrument for measuring clock jitter values, and is used in manufacturing [[DVD]] and [[CD-ROM]] discs.

Due to additional sector level addressing added in the [[Yellow Book (CD standard)|Yellow Book]], [[CD-ROM]] data discs are not subject to seek jitter.

==Jitter metrics==
For [[clock signal|clock]] jitter, there are three commonly used metrics: ''absolute jitter'', ''period jitter'', and ''cycle to cycle jitter''.

Absolute jitter is the [[absolute difference]] in the position of a clock's edge from where it would ideally be.

Period jitter (aka ''cycle jitter'') is the difference between any one clock period and the ideal/average clock period. Accordingly, it can be thought of as the discrete-time derivative of absolute jitter. Period jitter tends to be important in synchronous circuitry like digital state machines where the error-free operation of the circuitry is limited by the shortest possible clock period, and the performance of the circuitry is limited by the average clock period. Hence, synchronous circuitry benefits from minimizing period jitter, so that the shortest clock period approaches the average clock period.

Cycle-to-cycle jitter is the difference in length/duration of any two adjacent clock periods.  Accordingly, it can be thought of as the discrete-time derivative of period jitter.  It can be important for some types of clock generation circuitry used in [[microprocessor]]s and [[RAM]] interfaces.

Since they have different generation mechanisms, different circuit effects, and different measurement methodology, it is useful to quantify them separately.

In [[telecommunications]], the unit used for the above types of jitter is usually the ''Unit Interval'' (abbreviated ''UI'') which quantifies the jitter in terms of a fraction of the ideal period of a bit. &lt;!-- originally: [[clock signal|clock]], but this is misleading, signal could have a sup-rate clock or no clock at all. Defining UI relative to bit period makes more sense to me  --&gt;  This unit is useful because it scales with clock frequency and thus allows relatively slow interconnects such as [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] to be compared to higher-speed internet backbone links such as [[OC-192]].  Absolute units such as ''picoseconds'' are more common in microprocessor applications.  Units of ''degrees'' and ''radians'' are also used.

[[Image:standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|350px|In the normal distribution one [[standard deviation]] from the [[mean]] (dark blue) accounts for about 68% of the set, while two standard deviations from the mean (medium and dark blue) account for about 95% and three standard deviations (light, medium, and dark blue) account for about 99.7%.]]
If jitter has a [[Gaussian distribution]], it is usually quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of this distribution (aka. ''[[root mean square|RMS]]'').  Often, jitter distribution is significantly non-Gaussian.  This can occur if the jitter is caused by external sources such as power supply noise.  In these cases, ''peak-to-peak'' measurements are more useful.  Many efforts have been made to meaningfully quantify distributions that are neither Gaussian nor have meaningful peaks (which is the case in all real jitter).  All have shortcomings but most tend to be good enough for the purposes of engineering work.  Note that typically, the reference point for jitter is defined such that the ''[[Arithmetic mean|mean]]'' jitter is 0.

In [[computer network|networking]], in particular [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[computer network|networks]] such as the [[Internet]], jitter can refer to the variation ([[statistical dispersion]]) in the delay of the [[Packet (information technology)|packets]].

==Types==

===Random jitter===
Random Jitter, also called Gaussian jitter, is unpredictable electronic timing noise. Random jitter typically follows a [[Gaussian distribution]] or Normal distribution.  It is believed to follow this pattern because most noise or jitter in an [[electrical circuit]] is caused by [[thermal noise]], which has a  Gaussian distribution.  Another reason for random jitter to have a distribution like this is due to the [[central limit theorem]].  The central limit theorem states that composite effect of many uncorrelated noise sources, regardless of the distributions, approaches a Gaussian distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chow|first=Daniel|title=Jitter Visualization, Part 1: Random Jitter|url=http://www.designconcommunity.com/author.asp?section_id=3017&amp;doc_id=261545&amp;|publisher=UBM Tech|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.

===Deterministic jitter===
[[Deterministic jitter]] is a type of [[clock signal|clock]] timing jitter or data signal jitter that is predictable and reproducible. The peak-to-peak value of this jitter is bounded, and the bounds can easily be observed and predicted. Deterministic jitter can either be correlated to the data stream ([[data-dependent jitter]]) or uncorrelated to the data stream (bounded uncorrelated jitter). Examples of data-dependent jitter are duty-cycle dependent jitter (also known as duty-cycle distortion) and [[intersymbol interference]].

'''Deterministic jitter''' (or '''DJ''') has a known non-[[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] [[probability distribution]].

|}

===Total jitter===
Total jitter (''T'') is the combination of random jitter (''R'') and deterministic jitter (''D''):

:{{math|1=''T'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;peak-to-peak&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;times; ''n''&amp;times;''R''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;}},

in which the value of ''n'' is based on the bit error rate (BER) required of the link.

A common bit error rate used in communication standards such as [[Ethernet]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Testing==
Testing for jitter and its measurement is of growing importance to electronics engineers because of increased clock frequencies in digital electronic circuitry to achieve higher device performance. Higher clock frequencies have commensurately smaller eye openings, and thus impose tighter tolerances on jitter. For example, modern computer [[motherboard]]s have serial bus architectures with eye openings of 160 [[picosecond]]s or less. This is extremely small compared to parallel bus architectures with equivalent performance, which may have eye openings on the order of 1000 [[picosecond]]s.

Testing of device performance for jitter tolerance often involves the injection of jitter into electronic components with specialized test equipment.

Jitter is measured and evaluated in various ways depending on the type of circuitry under test. For example, jitter in serial bus architectures is measured by means of eye diagrams, according to industry accepted standards. A less direct approach—in which analog waveforms are digitized and the resulting data stream analyzed—is employed when measuring pixel jitter in [[frame grabber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Khvilivitzky | first=Alexander | title=Pixel Jitter in Frame Grabbers | year=2008 | url=http://www.sensoray.com/support/pixjiter.htm | accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the goal of jitter measurement is to verify that the jitter will not disrupt normal operation of the circuitry.

There are standards for jitter measurement in serial bus architectures. The standards cover [[jitter tolerance]], [[jitter transfer function]] and [[jitter generation]], with the required values for these attributes varying among different applications. Where applicable, compliant systems are required to conform to these standards.

==Mitigation==

=== Anti-jitter circuits===
Anti-jitter circuits (AJCs) are a class of [[electronic circuit]]s designed to reduce the level of jitter in a regular pulse [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]. AJCs operate by re-timing the output pulses so they align more closely to an idealised pulse signal. They are widely used in clock and data recovery circuits in [[digital communications]], as well as for data sampling systems such as the [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]. Examples of anti-jitter circuits include [[phase-locked loop]] and [[delay-locked loop]]. Inside digital to analog converters jitter causes unwanted high-frequency distortions. In this case it can be suppressed with high fidelity clock signal usage.

===Jitter buffers===
Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are used to counter jitter introduced by queuing in  [[packet switching|packet switched network]]s so that a continuous playout of audio (or video) transmitted over the network can be ensured.  The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the mediastream. In the context of [[packet-switched network]]s, the term ''[[packet delay variation]]'' is often preferred over ''jitter''.

Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network jitter characteristics. These are known as adaptive de-jitter buffers and the adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out, which may appear offensive to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that feature a [[Voice activity detection|VAD]]/[[Discontinuous Transmission|DTX]] encoded audio, that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.

===Dejitterizer===
A dejitterizer is a device that reduces jitter in a [[digital signal]]. A dejitterizer usually consists of an [[Variable length buffer|elastic buffer]] in which the signal is temporarily stored and then retransmitted at a rate based on the average rate of the incoming signal. A dejitterizer is usually ineffective in dealing with low-frequency jitter, such as waiting-time jitter.

===Filtering===
A filter can be designed to minimize the effect of sampling jitter. For more information, see the paper by S. Ahmed and T. Chen entitled, &quot;Minimizing the effects of sampling jitters in wireless sensors networks&quot;.

==Video and image jitter==
Video or image jitter occurs when the horizontal lines of video image frames are randomly displaced due to the corruption of synchronization signals or electromagnetic interference during video transmission. Model based dejittering study has been carried out under the framework of digital image/video restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''linear range''' is that range of input or output values for which an [[Electronics|electronic]] [[amplifier]] produces an output [[signal (information theory)|signal]] that is a direct, [[linear]] function of the input signal. That is, the output can be represented by the equation:

:''Output'' = ''Input'' &amp;times; ''Gain''

When operating in the linear range, no [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] occurs. If an amplifier were perfectly linear, no [[distortion]] ([[Total harmonic distortion|harmonic distortion]] or [[intermodulation distortion]]) would occur (although random [[noise]] may still be introduced).

[[Vacuum tube]] amplifiers tend to exhibit soft clipping; as they approach the maximum possible output value, the gain tends to drop, rounding the tops of the signal [[waveform]]. [[Transistor]] amplifiers, by comparison, tend to produce hard clipping; the gain remains approximately the same until the maximum possible output voltage is reached; at that point, hard clipping occurs and the waveform never exceeds that value. The sharp [[inflection point]]s thus produced in the output waveform tend to have many more high-order [[harmonic]]s. This is alleged to be the basis of the &quot;transistor sound&quot; that some [[audiophile]]s find offensive (although this would not have occurred if they would not have been driving their amplifiers beyond the linear range in the first place).

{{Antennas|Components of Antenna Systems}}

A '''low-noise block downconverter''' (or '''LNB''') is the receiving device mounted on [[satellite dish]]es used for [[satellite TV]] reception, which collects the radio waves from the dish.  Also called a '''low-noise block''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satnews.com/products/glossary.html#L|title=Glossary of Satellite Terms|work=Satnews.com|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calaz, R A. ''An Introduction To Domestic Radio TV And Satellite Reception'' CAI (2002) pp119&lt;/ref&gt; '''LNC''' (for '''low-noise converter'''), or even '''LND''' (for '''low-noise downconverter'''),&lt;ref name=&quot;WS article&quot;&gt;Bains, Geoff. &quot;Getting The Most Out Of An LNB&quot; ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' (November, 2008) pp50-51&lt;/ref&gt; the device is sometimes wrongly called an '''LNA''' ([[low-noise amplifier]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sat-universe.com/showthread.php?t=28023|title=Satellite Glossary|work=SatUniverse.com|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The LNB is a combination of low-noise amplifier, [[frequency mixer]], [[local oscillator]] and [[intermediate frequency|IF]] amplifier. It receives the [[microwave transmission|microwave]] signal from the satellite collected by the dish, amplifies it, and [[Downconverter|downconverts]] the block of frequencies to a lower block of [[intermediate frequency|intermediate frequencies]] (IF). This downconversion allows the signal to be carried to the indoor satellite TV receiver using relatively cheap  [[coaxial cable]]; if the signal remained at its original microwave frequency it would require an expensive and impractical [[waveguide]] line.

The LNB is usually a small box suspended on one or more short booms, or feed arms, in front of the dish reflector, at its focus (although [[parabolic antenna#Types|some dish designs]] have the LNB on or behind the reflector). The microwave signal from the dish is picked up by a [[feedhorn]] on the LNB and is fed to a section of [[waveguide]]. One or more metal pins, or probes, protrude into the waveguide at right angles to the axis and act as [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], feeding the signal to a [[printed circuit board|PCB]] inside the LNB's [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielded]] box for processing. The lower frequency IF output signal emerges from a socket on the box to which the coaxial cable connects. 

[[Image:LNB dissassembled.JPG|thumb|right|LNBF disassembled [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/3/33/20080810160759!LNB_dissassembled.JPG (All Parts)]. The waveguide carrying the microwave radio signal collected by the dish passes through the hole in the center. The pins visible at the top and left side of the hole project into the waveguide and receive the signal, converting it to [[radio frequency]] [[alternating current]]s which are processed by the circuit board.]]

[[File:LNB 1.JPG|thumb|Cross-section across a low-noise block downconverter.]]
[[File:LNB 2.JPG|thumb|Viewing of the pin and the horn antenna in a low-noise block downconverter.]]

The LNB gets its power from the receiver or [[set-top box]] inside the house. This [[phantom power]] is sent &quot;up&quot; the same coaxial cable that carries the received signals &quot;down&quot; to the receiver, eliminating the need for a separate power cable. 

A corresponding component, called a [[block upconverter]] (BUC), is used at the [[satellite earth station]] ([[uplink]]) dish to convert the band of television channels to the microwave uplink frequency.

==Amplification and noise==
The signal received by the LNB is extremely weak and it has to be amplified before downconversion. The [[low noise amplifier]] section of the LNB amplifies this weak signal while adding the minimum possible amount of noise to the signal. 

The low-noise quality of an LNB is expressed as the [[noise figure]] (or sometimes [[noise temperature]]). This is the ratio of the amount of noise in the output to the amount in the input, in [[decibels]] (dB). The ideal LNB would have a noise figure of 0dB. Every LNB introduces some noise, although clever design, expensive components and even individual tweaking of the LNB after manufacture, can reduce noise levels to very low levels.

Every LNB off the production line has a different noise figure because of manufacturing tolerances. The noise figure quoted in the specifications - important for determining the LNB's suitability - is usually representative of neither that particular LNB nor the performance across the whole frequency range, since the noise figure most often quoted is the ''typical'' figure averaged over the production batch.
[[Image:Universal-euro-sat-lnb.jpg|thumb|right|120px|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band linear-polarized LNBF]]

==Block downconversion==
Satellites use comparatively high [[radio frequencies]] ([[microwave]]s) to transmit their TV [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s. As microwave satellite signals do not easily pass through [[wall]]s, [[roof]]s, or even [[glass]] [[window]]s, it is preferable for satellite [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s to be mounted outdoors. Plastic glazing however is transparent to microwaves and residential satellite dishes have successfully been hidden indoors looking through [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] attic windows to preserve the aesthetics of the home. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satelliteguys.us/threads/322871-Ku-Dish-through-glass/page2|title=Ku dish through glass|work=satelliteguys.us|accessdate=November 06, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the LNB is to use the [[Superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] principle to take a block (or [[band (radio)|band]]) of relatively high frequencies and convert them to similar signals carried at a much lower frequency (called the [[intermediate frequency]] or IF). These lower frequencies travel through cables with much less [[attenuation]], so there is much more signal left at the satellite receiver end of the cable. It is also much easier and cheaper to design electronic circuits to operate at these lower frequencies, rather than the very high frequencies of satellite transmission. 

The frequency conversion is performed by mixing a fixed frequency produced by a [[local oscillator]] inside the LNB with the incoming signal, to generate two signals equal to the sum of their frequencies and the difference. The frequency sum signal is filtered out and the frequency difference signal (the IF) is amplified and sent down the cable to the receiver:

[[C-Band]]: IF frequency = local oscillator frequency - received frequency

[[Ku-Band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-Band]]: IF frequency = received frequency - local oscillator frequency

The local oscillator frequency determines what block of incoming frequencies is downconverted to the frequencies expected by the receiver. For example, to downconvert the incoming signals from [[Astra 1KR]], which transmits in a frequency block of 10.70-11.70&amp;nbsp;GHz, to within a standard European receiver’s IF tuning range of 950-2150&amp;nbsp;MHz, a 9.75&amp;nbsp;GHz local oscillator frequency is used, producing a block of signals in the band 950-1950&amp;nbsp;MHz.

For the block of higher transmission frequencies used by [[Astra 2A]] and [[Astra 2B|2B]] (11.70-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz), a different local oscillator frequency converts the block of incoming frequencies. Typically, a local oscillator frequency of 10.60&amp;nbsp;GHz is used to downconvert the block to 1100-2150&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is still within the receiver’s 950-2150&amp;nbsp;MHz IF tuning range.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Understanding lnb specifications | url =  http://www.satcritics.com/sc_tech_lnb.pdf | work = SatCritics Technicals | accessdate = 2011-11-08 | date = 2002-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a C-Band antenna setup, the transmission frequencies are typically 3.7-4.2&amp;nbsp;GHz. By using a local oscillator frequency of 5.150&amp;nbsp;GHz the IF will be 950-1450&amp;nbsp;MHz which is, again, in the receiver's IF tuning range.

For the reception of [[wideband]] satellite television [[carrier wave|carrier]]s, typically 27&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, the [[accuracy]] of the frequency of the LNB local oscillator need only be in the order of ±500&amp;nbsp;kHz, so low cost [[Dielectric resonator|dielectric oscillators (DRO)]] may be used. For the reception of narrow bandwidth carriers or ones using advanced [[modulation]] techniques, such as [[16-QAM]], highly stable and low phase noise LNB local oscillators are required.  These use an internal [[crystal oscillator]] or an external 10&amp;nbsp;MHz reference from the indoor unit and a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) [[oscillator]].

==LNBFs==

With the launch of the first DTH broadcast satellite in Europe ([[Astra 1A]]) by [[SES S.A.|SES]] in 1988, antenna design was simplified for the anticipated mass-market. In particular, the [[feedhorn]] (which gathers the signal and directs it to the LNB) and the [[polarizer]] (which selects between differently polarized signals) were combined with the LNB itself into a single unit, called an LNB-feed or LNB-feedhorn (LNBF), or even an &quot;Astra type&quot; LNB. The prevalence of these combined units has meant that today the term LNB is commonly used to refer to all antenna units that provide the block-downconversion function, with or without a feedhorn. 
[[Image:sky lnb.jpg|thumb|right|120px|LNBF for Sky Digital and Freesat in the UK]]

The Astra type LNBF that includes a feedhorn and polarizer is the most common variety, and this is fitted to a dish using a bracket that clamps a collar around the waveguide neck of the LNB between the feedhorn and the electronics package. The diameter of the LNB neck and collar is usually 40mm although other sizes are also produced. In the UK, the &quot;minidish&quot; sold for use with [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]] and [[Freesat]] uses an LNBF with an integrated clip-in mount.

LNBs without a feedhorn built-in are usually provided with a (C120) flange around the input waveguide mouth which is bolted to a matching flange around the output of the feedhorn or polarizer unit.

==Polarization==

It's common to [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] satellite TV signals because it provides a way of transmitting more TV channels using a given block of frequencies. This approach requires the use of receiving equipment that can filter incoming signals based on their polarisation. Two satellite TV signals can then be transmitted on the same frequency (or, more usually, closely adjacent frequencies) and provided that they are polarized differently, the receiving equipment can still separate them and display whichever one is currently required. 

Throughout the World, most satellite TV transmissions use vertical and horizontal [[linear polarization]] but in North America, [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] transmissions use left and right hand [[circular polarization]]. Within the waveguide of a North American DBS LNB a slab of [[dielectric]] material is used to convert left and right circular polarized signals to vertical and horizontal linear polarized signals so the converted signals can be treated the same. 

[[Image:old flange lnb.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A 1980s [[Ku band]] LNB (2.18&amp;nbsp;dB [[noise figure]]) without built-in polarization selection and with a WR75 fitting for separate feedhorn and polarizer]]

The probe inside the LNB waveguide collects signals that are polarized in the same plane as the probe. To maximise the strength of the wanted signals (and to minimise reception of unwanted signals of the opposite polarization), the probe is aligned with the polarization of the incoming signals. This is most simply achieved by adjusting the LNB's ''skew'' - its rotation about the waveguide axis. To remotely select between the two polarizations, and to compensate for inaccuracies of the skew angle, it used to be common to fit a ''polarizer'' in front of the LNB's waveguide mouth. This either rotated the incoming signal with an electromagnet around the waveguide (a magnetic polarizer) or rotated an intermediate probe within the waveguide using a servo motor (a mechanical polarizer) but such adjustable skew polarizers are rarely used today.

The simplification of antenna design that accompanied the first Astra DTH broadcast satellites in Europe to produce the LNBF extended to a simpler approach to the selection between vertical and horizontal polarized signals too. Astra type LNBFs incorporate two probes in the waveguide, at right angles to one another so that, once the LNB has been skewed in its mount to match the local polarization angle, one probe collects horizontal signals and the other vertical, and an electronic switch (controlled by the voltage of the LNB's power supply from the receiver: 13&amp;nbsp;V for vertical and 18&amp;nbsp;V for horizontal) determines which polarization is passed on through the LNB for amplification and block-downconversion.

Such LNBs can receive all the transmissions from a satellite with no moving parts and with just one cable connected to the receiver, and have since become the most common type of LNB produced.

==== Universal LNB (&quot;Astra&quot; LNB) ====
[[Image:astra lnb.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] type LNBF]]

In Europe, as [[SES S.A.|SES]] launched more [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites to the [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2°E]] orbital position in the 1990s, the range of [[downlink]] frequencies used in the [[Fixed satellite services|FSS]] band (10.70-11.70&amp;nbsp;GHz) grew beyond that catered for by the standard LNBs and receivers of the time. Reception of signals from [[Astra 1D]] required an extension of receivers' IF tuning range from 950-1950&amp;nbsp;MHz to 950-2150&amp;nbsp;MHz and a change of LNBs' local oscillator frequency from the usual 10&amp;nbsp;GHz to 9.75&amp;nbsp;GHz (so-called &quot;Enhanced&quot; LNBs). 

The launch of [[Astra 1E]] and subsequent satellites saw the first use by Astra of the [[BSS band]] of frequencies (11.70-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz) for new digital services and required the introduction of an LNB that would receive the whole frequency range 10.70-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz - the &quot;Universal&quot; LNB.

A Universal LNB has a switchable local oscillator frequency of 9.75/10.60&amp;nbsp;GHz to provide two modes of operation – low band reception (10.70-11.70&amp;nbsp;GHz) and high band reception (11.70-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz). The local oscillator frequency is switched in response to a 22&amp;nbsp;kHz signal superimposed on the supply voltage from the connected receiver. Along with the supply voltage level used to switch between polarizations, this enables a Universal LNB to receive both polarizations (Vertical and Horizontal) and the full range of frequencies in the satellite {{Ku band}} under the control of the receiver, in four sub-bands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pro.ses-astra.com/resources/dealers/dish_inst_broch1.pdf|title=Professional Dish Installation|publisher=ASTRA (GB) Limited|format=pdf|date=March 2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ka-band LNB ===

==Multi-output LNBs==

[[Image:octo lnb.jpg|thumb|right|120px|An eight-output Octo LNBF]]

=== Dual/twin/quad/octo LNBs ===
[[Image:twin universal flange lnb.jpg|thumb|120px|A twin-output universal LNB with a C120 flange fitting for a separate feedhorn]]
An LNB with a single feedhorn but multiple outputs for connection to multiple tuners (in separate receivers or within the same receiver in the case of a twin-tuner PVR receiver). Typically, two, four or eight outputs are provided. Each output responds to the tuner’s band and polarization selection signals independently of the other outputs and &quot;appears&quot; to the tuner to be a separate LNB. Such an LNB usually may derive its power from a receiver connected to any of the outputs. Unused outputs may be left unconnected (but waterproofed for the protection of the whole LNB). 

Note: In the US, an LNB with two outputs is termed a &quot;dual LNB&quot; but in the UK, the term &quot;dual LNB&quot; historically described an LNB with two outputs, each producing one polarisation only, for connection to a multiswitch (the term and the LNBs fell out of use with the introduction of the universal LNB and the multiswitch equivalent, the quattro LNB - see below) and today &quot;dual LNB&quot; (and &quot;dual feed&quot;) describes antennas for reception from two satellite positions, using either two separate LNBs or a single Monoblock LNB with two feedhorns. In the UK, the term &quot;twin-output LNB&quot;, or simply &quot;twin LNB&quot;, is usually used for an LNB with a single feedhorn but two independent outputs.&lt;ref name=&quot;WS article&quot;/&gt;

=== Quattro LNBs ===
A special type of LNB intended for use in a shared dish installation to deliver signals to any number of tuners. A quattro LNB has a single feedhorn and four outputs, which each supply just one of the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; sub-bands (low band/horizontal polarization, high band/vertical polarization, low/vertical and high/horizontal) to a [[multiswitch]] or an array of multiswitches, which then delivers to each connected tuner whichever sub-band is required by that tuner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onastra.com/288905/glossary?category=q|title=Astra Glossary - Quattro LNB |publisher=SES ASTRA| accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a quattro LNB typically looks similar to a quad LNB, it cannot (sensibly) be connected to receivers directly. Note again the difference between a quad and a quattro LNB: A quad LNB can drive four tuners directly, with each output providing signals from the entire K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band. A quattro LNB is for connection to a multiswitch in a shared dish distribution system and each output provides only a quarter of the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band signals.

[[Image:Unicable.jpg|120px|thumb|SCR LNB with three SCR taps for daisy-chaining multiple tuners]]

===SCR/unicable LNBs===
Multiple tuners may also be fed from an [[Satellite channel router|SCR]] or [[Unicable (technology)|Unicable]] LNB in a [[single cable distribution]] system. A Unicable LNB has one output connector but operates in a different way to standard LNBs so it can feed multiple tuners daisy-chained along a single coax cable.

Instead of block-downconverting the whole received spectrum, an SCR LNB downconverts a small section of the received signal (equivalent to the bandwidth of a single transponder on the satellite) selected according to a [[DiSEqC]]-compliant command from the receiver, to output at a fixed frequency in the IF. Up to 16 tuners can be allocated a different frequency in the IF range and for each, the SCR LNB downconverts the corresponding individually requested transponder.&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff. &quot;Inverto Unicable LNB&quot; ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' (February, 2006) pp60-62&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most SCR LNBs also include either a legacy mode of operation or a separate legacy output which provides the received spectrum block-downconverted to the whole IF range in the conventional way.

==Optical-fibre LNBs==
LNBs for [[fibre satellite distribution]] systems operate in a similar way to conventional electrical LNBs, except that all four of the sub-bands in the entire Ku Band spectrum of 11.70&amp;nbsp;GHz-12.75&amp;nbsp;GHz across two signal [[Polarization (waves)|polarisations]] are simultaneously block-downconverted (as in a Quattro LNB). The fours sub-bands’ IFs are stacked to create one IF with a range of 0.95&amp;nbsp;GHz-5.45&amp;nbsp;GHz (a bandwidth of 4500&amp;nbsp;MHz), which is modulated on an optical signal using a [[semiconductor laser]], to send down the fibre cable.

At the receiver, the optical signal is converted back to the traditional electrical signal to &quot;appear&quot; to the receiver as a conventional LNB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalinvacom.com/products/fibreopticlnb2.php |title= FibreMDU Optical LNB |publisher= Global Invacom | accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monoblock LNBs ==
[[Image:monoblock lnb.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A twin-output monoblock LNBF for [[Astra 19.2°E]] and Hot Bird with a collar size adapter fitted]]
A [[Monoblock LNB]] (also spelled &quot;monobloc&quot;) is a unit consisting of two LNBs and is designed to receive satellites spaced close together, generally 6°. For example in parts of Europe, monoblocks designed to receive the [[Hot Bird]] and [[Astra 19.2°E]] satellites are popular because they enable reception of both satellites on a single dish without requiring an expensive, slow and noisy motorised dish. A similar advantage is provided by the [[duo LNB]] for simultaneous reception of signals from both the [[Astra 23.5°E]] and [[Astra 19.2°E]] positions.

== Cold temperatures ==
It is possible for any moisture in an LNB to physically freeze due to ice build-up in very low temperatures. This is only likely to occur when the LNB is not receiving power from the satellite receiver (i.e. no programmes are being watched).  To combat this, many satellite receivers provide an option to keep the LNB powered while the receiver is on standby. In fact most LNBs are kept powered because this helps to stabilise the temperature and, thereby, the local oscillator frequency by the dissipated heat from the circuitry of LNB. In the case of UK [[BSkyB]] receivers, the LNB remains powered while in standby so that the receiver can receive [[firmware]] updates and [[Electronic Programme Guide]] updates. In the United States the LNB connected to [[Dish Network]] receivers remains powered as well as those receivers that receive software and firmware updates and guide information over the air at night. In Turkey, another LNB type [[Digiturk]] MDUs are kept powered to receive [[Video on demand|VOD]] content, STB firmware, EPG data and pay TV keys in order to watch encrypted content.

Conductor (A) is separated from ground plane (D) by dielectric substrate (C). Upper dielectric (B) is typically air.]] '''Microstrip''' is a type of electrical [[transmission line]] which can be fabricated using [[printed circuit board]] technology, and is used to convey [[microwave]]-frequency signals. It consists of a conducting strip separated from a [[ground plane]] by a [[dielectric]] layer known as the substrate. Microwave components such as [[microstrip antenna|antennas]], [[directional coupler|coupler]]s, [[distributed element filter|filter]]s, [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Other power dividers|power divider]]s etc. can be formed from microstrip, the entire device existing as the pattern of metallization on the substrate. Microstrip is thus much less expensive than traditional [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] technology, as well as being far lighter and more compact.  Microstrip was developed by ITT laboratories as a competitor to [[stripline]] (first published by Grieg and Engelmann in the December 1952 IRE proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grieg|first=D. D.|coauthors=Engelmann, H. F.|date=Dec 1952|title=Microstrip-A New Transmission Technique for the Klilomegacycle Range|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1644–1650|issn=0096-8390|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1952.274144}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The disadvantages of microstrip compared with waveguide are the generally lower power handling capacity, and higher losses. Also, unlike waveguide, microstrip is not enclosed, and is therefore susceptible to cross-talk and unintentional radiation.

For lowest cost, microstrip devices may be built on an ordinary [[FR-4]] (standard PCB) substrate. However it is often found that the dielectric losses in FR4 are too high at microwave frequencies, and that the [[dielectric constant]] is not sufficiently tightly controlled. For these reasons, an [[alumina]] substrate is commonly used.

On a smaller scale, microstrip transmission lines are also built into [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s.

Microstrip lines are also used in high-speed digital PCB designs, where signals need to be routed from one part of the assembly to another with minimal distortion, and avoiding high cross-talk and radiation.

Microstrip is very similar to [[stripline]] and [[coplanar waveguide]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and it is possible to integrate all three on the same substrate.

== Inhomogeneity ==
The electromagnetic wave carried by a microstrip line exists partly in the [[dielectric]] substrate, and partly in the air above it. In general, the [[dielectric constant]] of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence, the propagation velocity is somewhere between the speed of radio waves in the substrate, and the speed of radio waves in air. This behaviour is commonly described by stating the effective dielectric constant (or effective relative permittivity) of the microstrip; this being the dielectric constant of an equivalent homogeneous medium (i.e., one resulting in the same propagation velocity).

Further consequences of an inhomogeneous medium include:

* The line will not support a true [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|TEM]] wave; at non-zero frequencies, both the [[electric field|E]] and [[magnetic field|H fields]] will have longitudinal components (a [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|hybrid mode]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;denlinger1971&quot;&gt;E. J. Denlinger, “A frequency dependent solution for microstrip transmission lines”; ''IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-19, pp. 30-39, Jan. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The longitudinal components are small however, and so the dominant mode is referred to as quasi-TEM.
* The line is [[dispersion (optics)|dispersive]]. With increasing frequency, the effective dielectric constant gradually climbs towards that of the substrate, so that the [[phase velocity]] gradually decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;denlinger1971&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cory1981&quot;&gt;H. Cory, “Dispersion characteristics of microstrip lines”; ''IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-29, pp. 59-61, Jan. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true even with a non-dispersive substrate material (the substrate dielectric constant will usually fall with increasing frequency).
* The [[characteristic impedance]] of the line changes slightly with frequency (again, even with a non-dispersive substrate material). The characteristic impedance of non-TEM modes is not uniquely defined, and depending on the precise definition used, the impedance of microstrip either rises, falls, or falls then rises with increasing frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;bianco1978&quot;&gt;B. Bianco, L. Panini, M. Parodi, and S. Ridetlaj “Some considerations about the frequency dependence of the characteristic impedance of uniform microstrips”: ''IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-26, pp. 182-185, March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The low-frequency limit of the characteristic impedance is referred to as the quasi-static characteristic impedance, and is the same for all definitions of characteristic impedance.
* The [[wave impedance]] varies over the cross-section of the line.

== Characteristic impedance ==
A closed-form approximate expression for the quasi-static [[characteristic impedance]] of a microstrip line was developed by [[Harold Alden Wheeler|Wheeler]]:&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of parallel wide strips by a conformal-mapping approximation”, ''IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-12, pp. 280-289, May 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wheeler1965&quot;&gt;H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of parallel strips separated by a dielectric sheet”, ''IEEE Tran. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-13, pp. 172-185, Mar. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wheeler1977&quot;&gt;H. A. Wheeler, “Transmission-line properties of a strip on a dielectric sheet on a plane”, ''IEEE Tran. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-25, pp. 631-647, Aug. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\textrm{microstrip} = \frac{Z_{0}}{2 \pi \sqrt{2 (1 + \varepsilon_{r})}} \mathrm{ln}\left( 1 + \frac{4 h}{w_\textrm{eff}} \left( \frac{14 + \frac{8}{\varepsilon_{r}}}{11} \frac{4 h}{w_\textrm{eff}} + \sqrt{\left( \frac{14 + \frac{8}{\varepsilon_{r}}}{11} \frac{4 h}{w_\textrm{eff}}\right)^{2} + \pi^{2} \frac{1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{r}}}{2}}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''effective width'', which is the actual width of the strip, plus a correction to account for the non-zero thickness of the metallization:

:&lt;math&gt;w_\textrm{eff} = w + t \frac{1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{r}}}{2 \pi} \mathrm{ln}\left( \frac{4 e}{\sqrt{\left( \frac{t}{h}\right)^{2} + \left( \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{1}{\frac{w}{t} + \frac{11}{10}}\right)^{2}}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[impedance of free space]], ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of substrate, ''w'' is the width of the strip, ''h'' is the thickness (&quot;height&quot;) of substrate, and ''t'' is the thickness of the strip metallization.

This formula is asymptotic to an exact solution in three different cases

#&lt;math&gt;w \gg h&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r}&lt;/math&gt; (parallel plate transmission line),
#&lt;math&gt;w \ll h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r} = 1&lt;/math&gt; (wire above a ground-plane) and
#&lt;math&gt;w \ll h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r} \gg 1.&lt;/math&gt;

It is claimed that for most other cases, the error in impedance is less than 1%, and is always less than 2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;wheeler1977&quot;/&gt; By covering all aspect-ratios in one formula, Wheeler 1977 improves on Wheeler 1965&lt;ref name=&quot;wheeler1965&quot;/&gt; which gives one formula for &lt;math&gt;w / h &gt; 3.3&lt;/math&gt; and another for &lt;math&gt;w / h \le 3.3&lt;/math&gt; (thus introducing a discontinuity in the result at &lt;math&gt;w / h = 3.3&lt;/math&gt;). Nevertheless, the 1965 paper is perhaps the more often cited. A number of other approximate formulae for the characteristic impedance have been advanced by other authors. However, most of these are applicable to only a limited range of aspect-ratios, or else cover the entire range piecewise.

Curiously, Harold Wheeler disliked both the terms 'microstrip' and 'characteristic impedance', and avoided using them in his papers.

==Bends==
In order to build a complete circuit in microstrip, it is often necessary for the path of a strip to turn through a large angle. An abrupt 90° bend in a microstrip will cause a significant portion of the signal on the strip to be reflected back towards its source, with only part of the signal transmitted on around the bend. One means of effecting a low-reflection bend, is to curve the path of the strip in an arc of radius at least 3 times the strip-width.&lt;ref&gt;T.H. Lee, Planar Microwave Engineering; ''Cambridge University Press'', pp. 173-174, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a far more common technique, and one which consumes a smaller area of substrate, is to use a mitred bend.

[[Image:microstrip-bend.svg|thumb|left|200px|Microstrip 90° mitred bend. The percentage mitre is 100x/d]] To a first approximation, an abrupt un-mitred bend behaves as a shunt capacitance placed between the ground plane and the bend in the strip. Mitring the bend reduces the area of metallization, and so removes the excess capacitance. The percentage mitre is the cut-away fraction of the diagonal between the inner and outer corners of the un-mitred bend.

The optimum mitre for a wide range of microstrip geometries has been determined experimentally by Douville and James.&lt;ref name=&quot;douville1978&quot;&gt;R. J. P. Douville and D. S. James, Experimental study of symmetric microstrip bends and their compensation; ''IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory Tech.'', vol. MTT-26, pp. 175-182, Mar. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; They find that a good fit for the optimum percentage mitre is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M = 100 \frac{x}{d} \% = (52 + 65 e^{- \frac{27}{20} \frac{w}{h}}) \%&lt;/math&gt;

subject to &lt;math&gt;w/h \ge 0.25&lt;/math&gt; and with the substrate dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r} \le 25&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is entirely independent of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{r}&lt;/math&gt;. The actual range of parameters for which Douville and James present evidence is &lt;math&gt;0.25 \le w/h \le 2.75&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2.5 \le \varepsilon_{r} \le 25&lt;/math&gt;. They report a [[VSWR]] of better than 1.1 (i.e., a return better than &amp;minus;26&amp;nbsp;dB) for any percentage mitre within 4% (of the original &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) of that given by the formula. At the minimum &lt;math&gt;w/h&lt;/math&gt; of 0.25, the percentage mitre is 98.4%, so that the strip is very nearly cut through.

For both the curved and mitred bends, the electrical length is somewhat shorter than the physical path-length of the strip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41818">'''Multi-junction solar cells''' are [[solar cell]]s with multiple p-n junctions made of different semiconductor materials.  Each material's p-n junction will produce electric current in response to a different [[Electromagnetic spectrum|wavelength of light]].   A multi-junction cell solar cell will produce electric current at multiple wavelengths of light, increasing the conversion efficiency of the no-cost solar light power to usable electric power.

Traditional single-junction cells have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 34%.  Theoretically, with an infinite number of junctions, multi-junction cell efficiency would be 87% under highly concentrated sunlight.

Currently, the best lab examples of traditional silicon solar cells have efficiencies around 25%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsinnovations.com.au/news/solar_cell_record.html |title=New South Innovations News - UNSW breaks solar cell record |publisher=NewSouth Innovations |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while lab examples of multi-junction cells have demonstrated performance over 43%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20053851-54.html &quot;Solar Junction Breaks Concentrated Solar World Record with 43.5% Efficiency&quot;].

However, this efficiency is gained at the cost of increased complexity and manufacturing price. To date, their higher price and higher [[price-to-performance ratio]] have limited their use to special roles, notably in [[aerospace]] where their high [[power-to-weight ratio]] is desirable. In terrestrial applications these solar cells have been suggested for use in [[concentrated photovoltaics]] (CPV),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/concentrating_pv.html &quot;Concentrating Photovoltaic Technology&quot;], NREL&lt;/ref&gt; with numerous small test sites around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qualenergia.it/sites/default/files/articolo-doc/Mappa%20fotovoltaico%20a%20concentrazione%20nel%20mondo.pdf CPV World Map 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tandem fabrication techniques are used to improve the performance of existing many designs. In particular, the technique can be applied to lower cost [[thin-film solar cell]]s using [[amorphous silicon]], as opposed to mono-crystalline silicon, to produce a cell with about 10% efficiency that is lightweight and flexible. This approach has been used by several commercial vendors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-solar.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Energy_Production_EN.pdf &quot;Uni-Solar Energy Production&quot;], Uni-Solar&lt;/ref&gt; but these products are currently limited to certain niche roles, like roofing materials.

==Description==

===Basics of solar cells===
[[File:Effetphotovoltaic.jpg|right|thumb|325px|Figure A. [[Band diagram]] illustration of the [[photovoltaic effect]]. [[Photon]]s give their energy to electrons in the depletion or quasi-neutral regions. These move from [[conduction band]] to [[valence band]]. Depending on the location, [[electron]]s and [[Electron hole|holes]] are accelerated by ''E&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt;'', which gives generation [[photocurrent]], or by E&lt;sub&gt;scatt&lt;/sub&gt;, which gives scattering photocurrent.&lt;ref name=a7&gt;R.Delamare, O.Bulteel, D.Flandre, Conversion lumière/électricité: notions fondamentales et exemples de recherche&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Traditional photovoltaic cells are commonly composed by [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[silicon]] and then depositing metallic contacts on the top and bottom. The doping is normally applied to a thin layer on the top of the cell, producing a [[pn-junction]] with a particular [[bandgap]] energy, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Photon]]s that hit the top of the solar cell are either reflected or transmitted into the cell. Transmitted photons have the potential to give their energy ''hν'' to an [[electron]] if ''hν'' ≥ E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, generating an electron-[[electron hole|hole]] pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_Xs6QgAACAAJ &quot;Basic Photovoltaic Principles and Methods&quot;], Technical Information Office, Solar Energy Research Institute (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In the depletion region, the drift electric field ''E&lt;sub&gt;drift&lt;/sub&gt;'' accelerates both electrons and holes towards their respective n-doped and p-doped regions (up and down, respectively). The resulting [[electric current|current]] ''I&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the generation [[photocurrent]]. In the quasi-neutral region, the scattering electric field E&lt;sub&gt;scatt&lt;/sub&gt; accelerates holes (electrons) towards the p-doped (n-doped) region, which gives a scattering photocurrent ''I&lt;sub&gt;pscatt&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''I&lt;sub&gt;nscatt&lt;/sub&gt;''). Consequently, due to the accumulation of [[electric charge|charge]]s, a potential ''V'' and a photocurrent ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' appear. The expression for this photocurrent is obtained by adding generation and scattering photocurrents: ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;nscatt&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;pscatt&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The ''J-V'' characteristics (J is current density, i.e. current per unit area) of a solar cell under illumination are obtained by shifting the ''J-V'' characteristics of a [[diode]] in the dark downward by ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since solar cells are designed to supply power and not absorb it, the power ''P = V·I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;'' must be negative. Hence, the operating point ''(V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is located in the region where ''V''&gt;0 and ''I&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;0, and chosen to maximize the [[absolute value]] of the power |''P''|.&lt;ref name=a9&gt;{{cite book|url=http://sunlab.site.uottawa.ca/pdf/whitepapers/HiEfficMjSc-CurrStatus&amp;FuturePotential.pdf|author=N.V.Yastrebova|title=High-efficiency multi-junction solar cells: current status and future potential|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss mechanisms===
[[File:ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg|thumb|The [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the efficiency of a single-junction solar cell. It is essentially impossible for a single-junction solar cell, under unconcentrated sunlight, to have more than ~34% efficiency. A multijunction cell, however, can exceed that limit.]]

The theoretical performance of a solar cell was first studied in depth in the 1960s, and is today known as the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]]. The limit describes several loss mechanisms that are inherent to any solar cell design.

The first are the losses due to [[blackbody radiation]], a loss mechanism that affects any material object above [[absolute zero]]. In the case of solar cells at [[standard temperature and pressure]], this loss accounts for about 7% of the power. The second is an effect known as &quot;recombination&quot;, where the [[electron]]s created by the [[photoelectric effect]] meet the [[electron hole]]s left behind by previous excitations. In silicon, this accounts for another 10% of the power.

However, the dominant loss mechanism is the inability for a solar cell to extract all of the power in the [[photon]], and the associated problem that it cannot extract any power at all from certain photons. This is due to the fact that the electrons must have enough energy to overcome the bandgap of the material.

If the photon has less energy than the bandgap, it is not collected at all. This is a major consideration for conventional solar cells, which are not sensitive to most of the [[infrared]] spectrum, although that represents almost half of the power coming from the sun. Conversely, photons with more energy than the bandgap, say blue light, initially eject an electron to a state high above the bandgap, but this extra energy is lost through collisions in a process known as &quot;relaxation&quot;. This lost energy turns into heat in the cell, which has the side-effect of further increasing blackbody losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Third Generation Photovoltaics|last=Green|first=M.A.|year=2003|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-26562-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining all of these factors, the maximum efficiency for a single-bandgap material, like conventional silicon cells, is about 34%. That is, 66% of the energy in the sunlight hitting the cell will be lost. Practical concerns further reduce this, notably reflection off the front surface or the metal terminals, with modern high-quality cells at about 22%.

Lower, also called narrower, bandgap materials will convert longer wavelength, lower energy photons.  Higher, or wider bandgap materials will convert shorter wavelength, higher energy light   An analysis of the [[AM1.5]] spectrum, shows the best balance is reached at about 1.1&amp;nbsp;eV, in the near infrared, which happens to be very close to the natural bandgap in silicon and a number of other useful semiconductors.

===Multi-junction cells===

Cells made from multiple materials have multiple bandgaps. So, it will respond to multiple light wavelengths and some of the energy that would otherwise be lost to relaxation as described above, can be captured and converted.

For instance, if one had a cell with two bandgaps in it, one tuned to red light and the other to green, then the extra energy in green, cyan and blue light would be lost only to the bandgap of the green-sensitive material, while the energy of the red, yellow and orange would be lost only to the bandgap of the red-sensitive material. Following analysis similar to those performed for single-bandgap devices, it can be demonstrated that the perfect bandgaps for a two-gap device are at 1.1 eV and 1.8 eV.&lt;ref name=super&gt;[http://www.superstrate.net/pv/limit/tandem.html &quot;Tandem solar cells&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conveniently, light of a particular wavelength does not interact strongly with materials that are not a multiple of that wavelength. This means that you can make a multijunction cell by layering the different materials on top of each other, shortest wavelengths on the &quot;top&quot; and increasing through the body of the cell. As the photons have to pass through the cell to reach the proper layer to be absorbed, [[Transparent conducting film|transparent conductors]] need to be used to collect the electrons being generated at each layer.

[[File:StructureMJetspectre.png|thumb|550px|Figure C. (a) The structure of an MJ solar cell. There are six important types of layers: pn junctions, back surface field (BSF) layers, window layers, tunnel junctions, [[anti-reflective coating]] and metallic contacts. (b) Graph of spectral irradiance E vs. wavelength λ over the [[Air mass coefficient|AM]]1.5 solar spectrum, together with the maximum electricity conversion efficiency for every junction as a function of the wavelength.&lt;ref name=a9 /&gt;]]

Producing a tandem cell is not an easy task, largely due to the thinness of the materials and the difficulties extracting the current between the layers. The easy solution is to use two mechanically separate [[thin film solar cell]]s and then wire them together separately outside the cell. This technique is widely used by [[amorphous silicon]] solar cells, [[Uni-Solar]]'s products use three such layers to reach efficiencies around 9%. Lab examples using more exotic thin-film materials have demonstrated efficiencies over 30%.&lt;ref name=super/&gt;

The more difficult solution is the &quot;monolithically integrated&quot; cell, where the cell consists of a number of layers that are mechanically and electrically connected. These cells are much more difficult to produce because the electrical characteristics of each layer has to be carefully matched. In particular, the photocurrent generated in each layer needs to be matched, otherwise electrons will be absorbed between layers. This limits their construction to certain materials, best met by the III-V semiconductors.&lt;ref name=super/&gt;

====Material Choice====

The choice of materials for each sub-cell is determined by the requirements for lattice-matching, current-matching, and high performance opto-electronic properties.

For optimal growth and resulting crystal quality, the crystal lattice constant ''a'' of each material must be closely matched, resulting in lattice-matched devices. This constraint has been relaxed somewhat in recently developed [[Solar cell research#Metamorphic multijunction solar cell|metamorphic solar cells]] which contain a small degree of lattice mismatch. However, a greater degree of mismatch or other growth imperfections can lead to crystal defects causing a degradation in electronic properties.

Since each sub-cell is connected electrically in series, the same current flows through each junction. The materials are ordered with decreasing [[bandgap]]s, E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, allowing sub-bandgap light (''hc/λ &lt; e·E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') to transmit to the lower sub-cells. Therefore, suitable bandgaps must be chosen such that the design spectrum will balance the current generation in each of the sub-cells, achieving current matching. Figure C(b) plots [[spectral irradiance]] ''E''(λ), which is the source power density at a given [[wavelength]] λ. It is plotted together with the maximum conversion efficiency for every junction as a function of the wavelength, which is directly related to the number of photons available for conversion into photocurrent.

Finally, the layers must be electrically optimal for high performance. This necessitates usage of materials with strong absorption coefficients α(λ), high minority carrier lifetimes τ&lt;sub&gt;minority&lt;/sub&gt;, and high mobilities µ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=R|title=Photovoltaic solar cells: Choice of materials and production methods|journal=Vacuum|volume=80|issue=10|page=1090|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2006.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The favorable values in the table below justify the choice of materials typically used for multi-junction solar cells: [[InGaP]] for the top sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 - 1.9 eV), [[InGaAs]] for the middle sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 eV), and [[Germanium]] for the bottom sub-cell (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.67 eV). The use of Ge is mainly due to its lattice constant, robustness, low cost, abundance, and ease of production. 

Because the different layers are closely lattice-matched, the fabrication of the device typically employs [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|metal-organic chemical vapor deposition]] (MOCVD). This technique is preferable to the [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) because it ensures high [[crystal]] quality and large scale production.&lt;ref name=a9 /&gt;

===Structural elements===

====Metallic contacts====
The metallic contacts are low-resistivity [[electrodes]] that make contact with the semiconductor layers.  They are often [[aluminum]].  This provides an electrical connection to a load or other parts of a solar cell array.  They are usually on two sides of the cell. And are can be important on the back face of so that shadowing on the lighting surface is reduced.

====Anti-reflective coating====

[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflective]] (AR) coating is generally composed of several layers in the case of MJ solar cells. The top AR layer has usually a [[NaOH]] surface texturation with several [[pyramid]]s in order to increase the transmission coefficient ''T'', the trapping of the light in the material (because photons cannot easily get out the MJ structure due to pyramids) and therefore, the path length of photons in the material.&lt;ref name=a7 /&gt; On the one hand, the thickness of each AR layer is chosen to get destructive interferences. Therefore, the reflection coefficient ''R'' decreases to 1%. In the case of two AR layers ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the top layer, usually {{chem|SiO|2}}) and ''L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' (usually {{chem|TiO|2}}), there must be &lt;math&gt;n_{L2} = n_{AlInP}^{1/2} \cdot n_{L1}&lt;/math&gt; to have the same amplitudes for reflected fields and ''n&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;L1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4λ&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''n&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;L2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = λ&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;/4 to have opposite phase for reflected fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strehlke|first1=S|last2=Bastide|first2=S|last3=Guillet|first3=J|last4=Levyclement|first4=C|title=Design of porous silicon antireflection coatings for silicon solar cells|journal=Materials Science and Engineering B|volume=69-70|page=81|year=2000|doi=10.1016/S0921-5107(99)00272-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the thickness of each AR layer is also chosen to minimize the reflectance at wavelengths for which the photocurrent is the lowest. Consequently, this maximizes ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' by matching currents of the three subcells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1099-159X(200011/12)8:6&lt;563::AID-PIP327&gt;3.0.CO;2-8|author=Daniel J.Aiken|journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications|volume=8|title=Antireflection coating design for multi-junction, series interconnected solar cells|year=2000|issue=6|pages=563–570|url=http://photovoltaics.sandia.gov/docs/PDF/aikencell.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As example, because the current generated by the bottom cell is greater than the currents generated by the other cells, the thickness of AR layers is adjusted so that the infrared (IR) transmission (which corresponds to the bottom cell) is degraded while the [[ultraviolet]] transmission (which corresponds to the top cell) is upgraded. Particularly, an AR coating is very important at low wavelengths because, without it, ''T'' would be strongly reduced to 70%.

====Tunnel junctions====
[[File:Tunneljunction.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure D: Layers and [[band diagram]] of the tunnel junction. Because the length of the depletion region is narrow and the band gap is high, electrons can tunnel.]]

The main goal of [[tunnel junction]]s is to provide a low [[electrical resistance]] and optically low-loss connection between two subcells.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=M|last2=Takamoto|first2=T|last3=Araki|first3=K|title=Super high-efficiency multi-junction and concentrator solar cells|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=90|issue=18–19|page=3068|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2006.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, the p-doped region of the top cell would be directly connected with the n-doped region of the middle cell. Hence, a pn junction with opposite direction to the others would appear between the top cell and the middle cell. Consequently, the [[surface photovoltage|photovoltage]] would be lower than if there would be no parasitic [[diode]]. In order to decrease this effect, a tunnel junction is used.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;J.F.Klem, S.Park, J.C.Zolper, Semiconductor tunnel junction with enhancement layer, {{US Patent|5679963}}(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply a wide band gap, highly doped diode. The high doping reduces the length of the depletion region because
:&lt;math&gt;l_{depl} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \epsilon (\phi_0 - V)}{q} \frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, electrons can easily tunnel through the depletion region. The J-V characteristic of the tunnel junction is very important because it explains why tunnel junctions can be used to have a low electrical resistance connection between two pn junctions. Figure D shows three different regions: the tunneling region, the negative differential resistance region and the thermal diffusion region. The region where electrons can tunnel through the barrier is called the tunneling region. There, the voltage must be low enough so that energy of some electrons who are tunneling is equal to energy states available on the other side of the barrier. Consequently, current density through the tunnel junction is high (with maximum value of &lt;math&gt;J_P&lt;/math&gt;, the peak current density) and the slope near the origin is therefore steep. Then, the resistance is extremely low and consequently, the [[voltage]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.F.Wheeldon''et al.''|title=AlGaAs Tunnel Junction for high efficiency multi-junction solar cells: simulation and measurement of temperature-dependent operation|url=http://sunlab.site.uottawa.ca/pdf/conferences/PVSC2009_JWheeldon_AlGaAsTjHiEfficMjSc-Sim&amp;MeasTDep.pdf|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why tunnel junctions are ideal for connecting two pn junctions without having a voltage drop. When voltage is higher, electrons cannot cross the barrier because energy states are no longer available for electrons. Therefore, the current density decreases and the differential resistance is negative. The last region, called thermal diffusion region, corresponds to the J-V characteristic of the usual diode:

:&lt;math&gt;J = J_S \left(\exp\left(\frac{qV}{kT}\right) - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In order to avoid the reduction of the MJ solar cell performances, tunnel junctions must be transparent to wavelengths absorbed by the next photovoltaic cell, the middle cell, i.e. E&lt;sub&gt;gTunnel&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gMiddleCell&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Window layer and back-surface field====
[[File:Bsfwindow.jpg|left|thumb|500px|Figure E: (a) Layers and [[band diagram]] of a window layer. The surface recombination is reduced. (b) Layers and band diagram of a BSF layer. The scattering of carriers is reduced.]]

A window layer is used in order to reduce the surface recombination velocity ''S''. Similarly, a back-surface field (BSF) layer reduces the scattering of carriers towards the tunnel junction. The structure of these two layers is the same: it is a [[heterojunction]] which catches electrons (holes). Indeed, despite the [[electric field]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'', these cannot jump above the barrier formed by the heterojunction because they don't have enough energy, as illustrated in figure E. Hence, electrons (holes) cannot recombine with holes (electrons) and cannot diffuse through the barrier. By the way, window and BSF layers must be transparent to wavelengths absorbed by the next pn junction i.e. E&lt;sub&gt;gWindow&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gEmitter&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;gBSF&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;gEmitter&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the lattice constant must be close to the one of InGaP and the layer must be highly doped (''n'' ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=a3&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|p=390 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===J-V characteristic===

For maximum efficiency, each subcell should be operated at its optimal J-V parameters, which are not necessarily equal for each subcell. If they are different, the total current through the solar cell is the lowest of the three. By approximation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peharz|first1=G.|last2=Siefer|first2=G.|last3=Bett|first3=A.W.|title=A simple method for quantifying spectral impacts on multi-junction solar cells|journal=Solar Energy|volume=83|issue=9|page=1588|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2009.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it results in the same relationship for the short-circuit current of the MJ solar cell: ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; = min (J&lt;sub&gt;SC1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC3&lt;/sub&gt;)'' where ''J&lt;sub&gt;SCi&lt;/sub&gt;''(λ) is the short-circuit current density at a given wavelength λ for the subcell ''i''.

Because of the impossibility to obtain ''J&lt;sub&gt;SC1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;SC3&lt;/sub&gt;'' directly from the total J-V characteristic, the quantum efficiency ''QE''(λ) is utilized. It measures the ratio between the amount of electron-hole pairs created and the incident photons at a given wavelength λ. Let φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) be the photon flux of corresponding incident light in subcell ''i''and''QE''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) be the quantum efficiency of the subcell ''i''. By definition, this equates to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Lei|last2=Chen|first2=Nuofu|last3=Bai|first3=Yiming|last4=Cui|first4=Ming|last5=Zhang|first5=Han|last6=Gao|first6=Fubao|last7=Yin|first7=Zhigang|last8=Zhang|first8=Xingwang|title=Quantum efficiency and temperature coefficients of GaInP/GaAs dual-junction solar cell|journal=Science China Technological Sciences|volume=52|issue=5|page=1176|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11431-008-0203-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda) = \frac{J_{SCi}(\lambda)}{q \phi_i(\lambda)} \Rightarrow J_{SCi} = \int_{0}^{\lambda2} q \phi_i(\lambda) QE_i(\lambda) \, d \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by linking it with the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the number of photons absorbed per unit of length by a material. If it is assumed that each photon absorbed by a subcell creates an electron/hole pair (which is a good approximation), this leads to:&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;QE_i(\lambda) = 1 - e^{-\alpha(\lambda) d_i}&lt;/math&gt; where ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the thickness of the subcell ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;e^{-\alpha(\lambda) d_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the percentage of incident light which is not absorbed by the subcell ''i''.

Similarly, because
:&lt;math&gt;V = \sum_{i=1}^3 V_i&lt;/math&gt;, the following approximation can be used: &lt;math&gt;V_{OC} = \sum_{i=1}^3 V_{OCi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The values of &lt;math&gt;V_{OCi}&lt;/math&gt; are then given by the J-V diode equation:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = J_{0i} \left(e^{\frac{qV_i}{kT}}-1\right)-J_{SCi} \Rightarrow V_{OCi} \approx \frac{kT}{q} \ln(\frac{J_{SCi}}{J_{0i}})&lt;/math&gt;

== Materials ==

The majority of multi-junction cells that have been produced to date use three layers. These cells require the use of semiconductors that can be tuned to specific frequencies, which has led to most of them being made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) compounds, often germanium for the bottom-, GaAs for the middle-, and GaInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the top-cell.

=== Gallium arsenide substrate ===

Dual junction cells can be made on Gallium arsenide wafers.  Alloys of [[Indium gallium phosphide]] in the range In&lt;sub&gt;.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;.5&lt;/sub&gt;P through In&lt;sub&gt;.53&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;.47&lt;/sub&gt;P serve as the high band gap alloy.  This alloy range provides for the ability to have band gaps in the range of 1.92eV to 1.87eV.  The lower [[GaAs]] junction has a band gap of 1.42eV.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Germanium substrate ===

Triple junction cells consisting of [[Indium gallium phosphide]], [[Gallium arsenide]] or [[Indium gallium arsenide]] and [[Germanium]] can be fabricated on germanium wafers.  Early cells used straight gallium arsenide in the middle junction.  Later cells have utilized In&lt;sub&gt;0.015&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.985&lt;/sub&gt;As, due to the better lattice match to Ge, resulting in a lower defect density.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Due to the huge band gap difference between GaAs (1.42eV), and Ge (0.66eV), the current match is very poor, with the Ge junction operated significantly current limited.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Current efficiencies for commercial InGaP/GaAs/Ge cells approach 40% under concentrated sunlight &lt;ref&gt;http://www.azurspace.com/index.php/en/products/products-cpv/cpv-solar-cells&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectrolab.com/dataSheets.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Lab cells (partly using additional junctions between the GaAs and Ge junction) have demonstrated efficiencies above 40%.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Green, K. Emery, Y. Hishikawa, W. Warta, E.D. Dunlop, Solar cell efficiency tables (version 40). Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, 2012. 20(5): pp. 606-14. DOI: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pip.2267 10.1002/pip.2267]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indium phosphide substrate ===
[[Indium phosphide]] may be used as a substrate to fabricate cells with band gaps between 1.35eV and 0.74eV.  Indium Phosphide has a band gap of 1.35eV.  [[Indium gallium arsenide]](In&lt;sub&gt;0.53&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;0.47&lt;/sub&gt;As) is lattice matched to Indium Phosphide with a band gap of 0.74eV.  A quaternary alloy of Indium gallium arsenide phosphide can be lattice matched for any band gap in between the two.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Indium phosphide-based cells have the potential to work in tandem with gallium arsenide cells. The two cells can be optically connected in series (with the InP cell below the GaAs cell), or in parallel through the use of spectra splitting using a [[Dichroic filter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Performance improvements==

===Structure===

All MJ photovoltaic cells use [[III-V semiconductor]] materials. GaAsSb-based heterojunction tunnel diodes, instead of conventional InGaP highly doped tunnel diodes described above, have a lower tunneling distance. Indeed, in the heterostructure formed by GaAsSb and InGaAs, the valence band of GaAsSb is higher than the valence band of the adjoining p-doped layer.&lt;ref name=a2 /&gt; Consequently, the tunneling distance ''d&lt;sub&gt;tunnel&lt;/sub&gt;'' is reduced and so the tunneling current, which exponentially depends of ''d&lt;sub&gt;tunnel&lt;/sub&gt;'', is increased. Hence, the voltage is lower than that of the InGaP tunnel junction.
GaAsSb heterojunction tunnel diodes offer other advantages. The same current can be achieved by using a lower doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.C. Zolper ''et al.''|title=GaAsSb-based heterojunction tunnel diodes for tandem solar cell interconnects|doi=10.1109/WCPEC.1994.520724|year=1994|page=1843|volume=2|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10107906-3FIrKs/webviewable/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, because the lattice constant is larger for GaAsSb than Ge, one can use a wider range of materials for the bottom cell because more materials are lattice-matched to GaAsSb than to Ge.&lt;ref name=a2/&gt;

Chemical components can be added to some layers. Adding about one percent of [[Indium]] in each layer better matches lattice constants of the different layers.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=M|last2=Takamoto|first2=T|last3=Araki|first3=K|last4=Ekinsdaukes|first4=N|title=Multi-junction III–V solar cells: current status and future potential|journal=Solar Energy|volume=79|issue=1|page=78|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2004.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, there is about 0.08 percent of mismatching between layers, which inhibits performance. Adding aluminium to the top cell increases its band gap to 1.96 eV,&lt;ref name=a6 /&gt; covering a larger part of the solar spectrum and obtain a higher open-circuit voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The theoretical efficiency of MJ solar cells is 86.8% for an infinite number of pn junctions,&lt;ref name=a9/&gt; implying that more junctions increase efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency is 37, 50, 56, 72% for 1, 2, 3, 36 pn junctions, respectively, with the number of junctions increasing exponentially to achieve equal effiency increments.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt; The exponential relationship implies that as the cell approaches the limit of efficiency, the increase cost and complexity grow rapidly. Decreasing the thickness of the top cell increases the transmission coefficient ''T''.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

Finally, an InGaP hetero-layer between the p-Ge layer and the InGaAs layer can be added in order to create automatically the n-Ge layer by scattering during MOCVD growth and increase significantly the quantum efficiency ''QE''(λ) of the bottom cell.&lt;ref name=a6 /&gt; InGaP is advantageous because of its high scattering coefficient and low solubility in Ge.

===Spectral variations===

Solar spectrum at the Earth surface changes constantly depending on the weather and sun position. This results in the variation of φ(λ), ''QE''(λ), α(λ) and thus the short-circuit currents ''J&lt;sub&gt;SCi&lt;/sub&gt;''. As a result, the current densities ''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are not necessarily matched and the total current becomes lower. These variations can be quantified using the average photon energy (APE) which is the ratio between the spectral irradiance G(λ) (the power density of the light source in a specific wavelength λ) and the total photon flux density. It can be shown that a high (low) value for APE means low (high) wavelengths spectral conditions and higher (lower) efficiencies.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/WCPEC.2003.1306273|title=Impact of spectral effects on the electrical parameters of multijunction amorphous silicon cells|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2134/8216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus APE is a good indicator for quantifying the effects of the solar spectrum variations on performances and has the added advantage of being independent of the device structure and the absorption profile of the device.&lt;ref name=a4 /&gt;

===Use of light concentrators===

Light concentrators increase efficiencies and reduce the cost/efficiency ratio. The three types of light concentrators in use are refractive lenses like [[Fresnel lens]]es, reflective dishes (parabolic or cassegraine), and [[light guide optics]]. Thanks to these devices, light arriving on a large surface can be concentrated on a smaller cell. The intensity concentration ratio (or “suns”) is the average intensity of the focused light divided by 0.1 W/cm². If its value is ''X'' then the MJ current becomes ''X'' higher under concentrated illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp= 61 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp=449 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using concentrations on the order of 500 to 1000, meaning that a 1&amp;nbsp;cm² cell can use the light collected from 0.1 m² (as 1 m² equal 10000 cm²), produces the highest efficiencies seen to date. Three-layer cells are fundamentally limited to 63%, but existing commercial prototypes have already demonstrated over 40%.&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;Michael Kanellos, [http://news.cnet.com/Solar-cell-breaks-efficiency-record/2100-11395_3-6141527.html &quot;Solar cell breaks efficiency record&quot;], ''CNET News'', 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2008/625.html &quot;NREL Solar Cell Sets World Efficiency Record at 40.8 Percent&quot;], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 13 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These cells capture about 2/3 of their theoretical maximum performance, so assuming the same is true for a non-concentrated version of the same design, one might expect a three-layer cell of 30% efficiency. This is not enough of an advantage over traditional silicon designs to make up for their extra production costs. For this reason, almost all multi-junction cell research for terrestrial use is dedicated to concentrator systems, normally using mirrors or fresnel lenses.

Using a concentrator also has the added benefit that the number of cells needed to cover a given amount of ground area is greatly reduced. A conventional system covering 1 m² would require 625 16&amp;nbsp;cm² cells, but for a concentrator system only a single cell is needed, along with a concentrator. The argument for concentrated Multi-junction cells has been that the high cost of the cells themselves would be more than offset by the reduction in total number of cells. However, the downside of the concentrator approach is that efficiency drops off very quickly under lower lighting conditions. In order to maximize its advantage over traditional cells and thus be cost competitive, the concentrator system has to track the sun as it moves to keep the light focused on the cell and maintain maximum efficiency as long as possible. This requires a [[solar tracker]] system, which increases yield, but also cost.

==Fabrication==

Multi-junction cells are expensive to produce, using techniques similar to [[semiconduction|semiconductor device fabrication]], usually [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] but on &quot;chip&quot; sizes on the order of centimeters. In cases where outright performance is the only consideration, these cells have become common, they are widely used in [[satellite]] applications for instance, where the [[power-to-weight ratio]] overwhelms practically every other cost.

==Comparison with other technologies==

There are four main categories of photovoltaic cells: c-Si solar cells, [[thin film solar cell]]s, MJ solar cells and new technologies (including organic solar cells).

MJ solar cells and other photovoltaic devices have significant differences (see the table above). Physically, the main property of a MJ solar cell is having more than one pn junction in order to catch a larger photon energy spectrum while the main property of the [[thin film solar cell]] is to use thin films instead of thick layers in order to decrease the cost efficiency ratio. As of 2010, MJ solar panels are more expensive than others. These differences imply different applications: MJ solar cells are preferred in space and c-Si solar cells for terrestrian applications.

[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|500px]]
The efficiencies of solar cells and Si solar technology are relatively stable, while the efficiency of solar modules and multi-junction technology are progressing.

Measurements on MJ solar cells are usually made in laboratory, using light concentrators (this is often not the case for the other cells) and under standard test conditions (STCs). STCs prescribe, for terrestrial applications, the AM1.5 spectrum as the reference. This air mass (AM) corresponds to a fixed position of the sun in the sky of 48° and a fixed power of 833 W/m². Therefore, spectral variations of incident light and environmental parameters are not taken into account under STC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albuflasa|first1=H|last2=Gottschalg|first2=R|last3=Betts|first3=T|title=Modeling the effect of varying spectra on multi junction A-SI solar cells|journal=Desalination|volume=209|issue=1–3|page=78|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, performance of MJ solar cells in terrestrial environment is inferior to that achieved in laboratory. Moreover, MJ solar cells are designed such that currents are matched under STC, but not necessarily under field conditions. One can use ''QE''(λ) to compare performances of different technologies, but ''QE''(λ) contains no information on the matching of currents of subcells. An important comparison point is rather the output power per unit area generated with the same incident light.

==Applications==

As of 2010, the cost of MJ solar cells was too high to allow use outside of specialized applications. The high cost is mainly due to the complex structure and the high price of materials. Nevertheless, with light concentrators under illumination of at least 400 suns, [[Concentrated photovoltaics|MJ solar panels]] become practical.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

MJ cells are currently being utilized in the Mars rover missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0094-5765(02)00287-4| title = The performance of gallium arsenide/germanium solar cells at the Martian surface  | year = 2004 | author = D.

Please provide power-up date and allow users to calculate. --&gt;

The environment in space is quite different. Because there is no atmosphere, the solar spectrum is different (AM0). The cells have a poor current match due to a greater photon flux of photons above 1.87eV vs. those between 1.87eV and 1.42eV.  This results in too little current in the GaAs junction, and hampers the overall efficiency since the InGaP junction operates below MPP current and the GaAs junction operates above MPP current.  To improve current match, the InGaP layer is intentionally thinned to allow additional photons to penetrate to the lower GaAs layer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In terrestrial concentrating applications, the scatter of blue light by the atmosphere reduces the photon flux above 1.87eV, better balancing the junction currents.Radiation particles that are no longer filtered can cause damage the cell. There are two kinds of damage: [[ionisation]] and atomic displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luque|Hegedus|2003|pp=414 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, MJ cells offer higher radiation resistance, higher efficiency and a lower temperature coefficient.&lt;ref name=a3 /&gt;

'''Negative resistance''' is a property of some [[Electrical network|electric circuit]]s where an increase in the [[Electric current|current]] entering a port results in a decreased [[voltage]] across the same port. This is in contrast to a simple ohmic [[resistor]], which exhibits an increase in voltage under the same conditions. Negative resistors are theoretical and do not exist as a discrete component. However, some types of [[diode]]s (e.g., [[tunnel diode]]s) can be built that exhibit negative resistance in some part of their operating range. Such a differential negative resistance is illustrated in Figure 1 with a [[resonant-tunneling diode]].  Electric [[Gas discharge|discharges]] through gases exhibit negative resistance, and some [[chalcogenide]] glasses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=DC electric-field effect in bulk and thin-film Ge&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt; chalcogenide glass | last1 = Abdel-All | first1 = A. | last2 = Elshafieb | first2 = A. | last3 = Elhawaryb

In [[electronics]], negative resistance devices are used to make bistable switching circuits and [[electronic oscillator]]s, particularly at [[microwave]] [[frequency|frequencies]].

==Properties==
[[Image:Current-driven neg resistor graph.svg|right|thumb|300px|Figure 2: The IV curve of a theoretical negative resistor]]

Figure 2 shows a graph of a negative resistor, showing the negative slope.  In contrast to this, a  resistor will have a positive slope. [[Tunnel diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;GunnDiode&quot;&gt;W. Alan Davis, ''Microwave Semiconductor Circuit Design'', p. 329, Van Nostrand Reinhold ISBN 0-442-27211-1&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit a negative resistance region in their IV (current – voltage) curve. They have two terminals like a resistor; but are not linear devices. [[Unijunction transistor]]s also have negative resistance properties when a circuit is built using other components.

For negative resistance to be present there must be active components in the circuit providing a source of energy. This is because current through a negative resistance implies a source of energy just as current through positive resistance implies that energy is being dissipated. A resistor produces voltage that is proportional to the current through it according to [[Ohm's law]]. The IV curve of a true negative resistor has a negative slope and passes through the origin of the coordinate system  (the curve can only enter the 2nd and 4th quadrants if energy is being supplied). This is to be compared with devices such as the tunnel diode where there is no source of energy within the device.  The negative slope portion of the curve is entirely in the first quadrant and the curve passes through the origin into the third quadrant, never entering the second or fourth quadrants.&lt;ref&gt;N.

== History ==

In early research it was noticed that [[electric arc|arc discharge]] devices and some [[vacuum tube]] devices such as the [[dynatron]] exhibit negative differential resistance effects.&lt;ref&gt;For instance G Crisson, [http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol10-1931/articles/bstj10-3-485.pdf &quot;Negative Impedances and the Twin 21-Type Repeater&quot;], ''The Bell System Technical Journal'', p. 492, January 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[screen grid]] is at a higher potential than the [[plate electrode]] the secondary emission from the plate will result in large numbers of electrons being attracted to the screen grid.  If the plate voltage is reduced further the plate current to the screen grid will increase.   This effect is a negative resistance and when a screen grid tube is operated in this negative resistance region it is called a dynatron.&lt;ref&gt;Electronics and Radio Engineering, pp 196-197, Frederick E. Terman, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Small-signal transit-time effects in vacuum tube diodes can result in alternating positive and negative conductance.  This occurs when the transit time of the electrons is slightly over one cycle of the AC signal.&lt;ref&gt;Electronics and Radio Engineering, pp 212-215, Frederick E. Terman, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  Practical and economic devices only became available with [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state technology]]. The typical true negative impedance circuit—the [[negative impedance converter]] – is due to [[John G. Linvill]] (1953)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linvill, J.G.|title=Transistor Negative-Impedance Converters|journal=[[Proceedings of the IRE]]|pages=725–729|year=1953|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274251|volume=41|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the popular element with negative differential resistance—the [[tunnel diode]] – is due to [[Leo Esaki]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Vitold Belevitch|author=Belevitch, V|title=Summary of the history of circuit theory|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=50|issue=5|page=853|year=1962|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
[[File:Negative resistance by positive feedback.svg|thumb|Figure 3: Amplifier exhibiting negative resistance through positive feedback]]

Any amplifier with sufficient positive feedback will present a negative resistance at its input.  Referring to figure 3,

:&lt;math&gt; i = \frac{v - Av}{R_1} + {v \over R_{\mathrm {in}}} &lt;/math&gt;

and,

:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over R} \triangleq {i \over v} = \frac {1-A}{R_1} + {1 \over R_{in}} &lt;/math&gt;

If ''R''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is large,

:&lt;math&gt; R \simeq \frac {R_1}{1-A} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Operational amplifiers ===
[[File:Practical negative resistance op amp.svg|200px|thumb|right|Figure 4: Negative resistance circuit
]]
{{Main|Negative impedance converter}}

The negative resistance circuit shown in Figure 4 is an opamp implementation of the negative impedance converter. The two resistors R1 and the op amp constitute a negative feedback non-inverting amplifier with gain A = 2.  The input resistance (for an ideal opamp) is given by;

:&lt;math&gt; R_\text{in} \triangleq {v \over i} = -R \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The input port of the circuit can be connected into another network as if it were a negative resistance component.

In the general case &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; can be selected to produce any value of negative impedance.  Negative capacitances and negative inductances can both be simulated by these means.

===Components exhibiting negative differential resistance===
[[Tunnel diode]]s are heavily doped&lt;ref name=&quot;TunnelDiode&quot;&gt;RCA Tunnel Diode Manual&lt;/ref&gt; semiconductor junctions that have an &quot;N&quot; shaped transfer curve. A [[vacuum tube]] can also be made to exhibit negative resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Electron Tube Having Negative Resistance |author=J. Groszkowski|journal= Proceedings of the IRE |year=1936|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1936.228352|volume=24 |issue=7|page=1041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other negative resistance diodes have been built that have an &quot;S&quot; shaped transfer curve.&lt;ref&gt;Nyle Steiner [http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/els/zincosc-el.htm Zinc Negative Resistance Oscillator] 22 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When biased so that the operating point is in the negative resistance region, these devices can be used as an [[Amplifier]]. These devices can also be biased so that they will switch between two states very quickly, as the applied voltage changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TunnelDiode&quot; /&gt;
{{clear}}

===Neuronal models===
Some instances of neurons display regions of negative slope conductances (RNSC) in voltage-clamp experiments.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean and Schmidt, [http://jn.physiology.org/content/86/3/1131.full &quot;Voltage-sensitivity of motoneuron NMDA receptor channels is modulated by serotonin in the neonatal rat spinal cord&quot;], ''Journal of Neurophysiology'', vol. 86, no. 3, 1 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative resistance here is implied were one to consider the neuron a typical [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|Hodgkin–Huxley]] style circuit model.

== Applications ==

=== Oscillators ===
Many [[electronic oscillator]] circuits use [[Two-port network|one-port]] negative resistance devices, such as [[magnetron]] tubes, [[tunnel diode]]s and [[Gunn diode]]s. In these circuits, a [[resonator]], such as an [[LC circuit]], [[Crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or [[cavity resonator]], is connected across the negative resistance device, and a DC bias voltage applied. The negative resistance of the active device can be thought of as cancelling the (positive) effective loss resistance of the resonator, creating sustained oscillations. These circuits are frequently used for oscillators at [[microwave]] frequencies. Oscillators have also been built using the negative resistance region of amplifying devices like [[vacuum tube]]s, as in the [[dynatron oscillator]].

===Amplifiers===

[[File:Negative resistance amp.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 5: Negative resistance microwave amplifier using a circulator]]
[[File:10Gig Tunnel Amp M.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 6: 8–12 GHz tunnel diode amplifier, circa 1970]]
A device exhibiting negative resistance can be used to amplify a signal and this is an especially useful technique at [[microwave]] frequencies. Such devices do not present as pure negative resistance at these frequencies (in the case of the tunnel diode a large parallel capacitance is also present) and a matching filter is usually required. The reactive components of the device's equivalent circuit can be absorbed into the filter design so the circuit can be represented as a pure resistance followed by a bandpass filter. The output of this arrangement is fed into one [[two-port network|port]] of a three-port [[circulator]]. The other two ports constitute the input and output of the amplifier with the direction of circulation as shown in the diagram. Treating ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as being positive, the [[reflection coefficient]]s at the two ends of the filter are given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1 = \frac{Z_1 - R_0}{Z_1 + R_0}&lt;/math&gt; and, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_2 = \frac{Z_2 - R_1}{Z_2 + R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the filter has no resistive elements, there is no dissipation and the magnitudes of the two reflection coefficients must be equal,

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \Gamma_1 \right| = \left| \Gamma_2 \right| &lt;/math&gt;

The input power entering the circulator is directed at the matching filter, is reflected at both the input and output of the filter and a portion finally arrives at the load.  This portion is given by;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\mbox{out}}{P_\mbox{in}} = \left| \Gamma_1 \right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

For a well matched filter, the reflection coefficients will be very small in the passband and very little power will reach the load.  On the other hand if ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by a negative resistance such that,

:&lt;math&gt;R_0' = - R_0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; then,

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1' = \frac{Z_1 + R_0}{Z_1 - R_0}&lt;/math&gt; and,

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \Gamma_1' \right| = \left| \Gamma_2' \right| = \frac{1}{\left| \Gamma_1 \right|}&lt;/math&gt;

Now the reflection coefficients are very large and more power is reaching the load than was injected in the input port.  The net result of terminating one port in a negative resistance is amplification between the remaining two ports.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', pp. 4–9, McGraw-Hill 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mixers and frequency converters ===

The highly non-linear characteristics of tunnel diodes makes them useful as frequency mixers. The conversion gain of a tunnel diode mixer can be as high as 20 dB if it is biased to operate in the negative resistance region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/neets/book11/45j.htm Solid-state microwave devices]. tpub.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antenna design ===
Another concept of negative resistance exists in the domain of radio frequency antenna design. This is also known as negative impedance. It is not uncommon for an antenna containing multiple driven elements to exhibit apparent negative impedance in one or more of the driven elements.&lt;ref&gt;Roger L. Freeman, ''Radio System Design for Telecommunication'', page 805, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006
ISBN 0470050438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Belrose, &quot;VLF, LF and MF antennas&quot;, in: Alan W. Rudge (ed), ''The Handbook of Antenna Design, Volume 2'', page 612, [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]], 1983 ISBN 0906048877.&lt;/ref&gt;  This situation is different from the meaning of negative resistance in this article: the ratio of V/I is indeed negative but the slope of the IV curve remains positive at all points.  The same is true of any source of electric energy.  For instance a battery has a negative V/I ratio (positive I defined as going into the positive terminal) but a positive slope equal to its internal resistance.

===Impedance cancellation===
Negative impedances can be used to cancel the effects of positive impedances, for example, by eliminating the internal resistance of a voltage source or making the internal resistance of a current source infinite.
This property is used in telephony line repeaters&lt;ref&gt;Neil J. Boucher, ''The Paging Technology Handbook'', p. 143, John Wiley and Sons, 1995 ISBN 0-930633-17-2&lt;/ref&gt; and in circuits such as the Howland current source,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philbrickarchive.org/1964-1_v12_no1_the_lightning_empiricist.htm Impedance and admittance transformations using operational amplifiers]&lt;/ref&gt; Deboo integrator&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=1633 Consider The &quot;Deboo&quot; Integrator For Unipolar Noninverting Designs]&lt;/ref&gt; and load cancellers.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, W. et al., &quot;A Comprehensive Study on Current Source Circuits&quot;, ''IFMBE Proceedings'', '''Vol 17''', pp. 213–216, Springer, 2007 ISBN 3-540-73840-1 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-73841-1_57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128 Negative-Resistance Load Canceller Helps Drive Heavy Loads]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pink.noise.png|thumb|Analog display of random fluctuations in voltage: e.g., [[pink noise]].]]
In electronics, '''noise''' is a random fluctuation in an electrical signal, a characteristic of all [[electronics|electronic]] [[electrical circuit|circuits]].&lt;ref name=noise&gt;{{cite book |first=C. D. |last=Motchenbacher |first2=J. A. |last2=Connelly |title=Low-noise electronic system design |publisher=Wiley Interscience |year=1993 |isbn= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise generated by electronic devices varies greatly, as it can be produced by several different effects. [[Thermal noise]] is unavoidable at non-zero temperature (see [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]]), while other types depend mostly on device type (such as [[shot noise]],&lt;ref name=noise/&gt;&lt;ref name=shot&gt;{{cite journal |first=L.

In [[communication system]]s, noise is an error or undesired random disturbance of a useful information [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] in a [[communication channel]]. The noise is a summation of unwanted or disturbing energy from natural and sometimes man-made sources. Noise is, however, typically distinguished from [[Interference (communication)|interference]], (e.g. [[cross-talk]], deliberate [[Radio jamming|jamming]] or other unwanted [[electromagnetic interference]] from specific transmitters), for example in the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), [[signal-to-interference ratio]] (SIR) and [[signal to noise plus interference|signal-to-noise plus interference ratio]] (SNIR) measures. Noise is also typically distinguished from [[distortion]], which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the [[signal-to-noise and distortion ratio]] (SINAD). In a carrier-modulated passband analog communication system, a certain [[carrier-to-noise ratio]] (CNR) at the radio receiver input would result in a certain [[signal-to-noise ratio]] in the detected message signal. In a digital communications system, a certain [[Eb/N0|''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] (normalized signal-to-noise ratio) would result in a certain [[bit error rate]] (BER).

While noise is generally unwanted, it can serve a useful purpose in some applications, such as [[random number generation]] or [[Noise (electronics)#Dither|dithering]].

==Noise types==

===Thermal noise===
{{Main|Johnson–Nyquist noise}}

Johnson–Nyquist noise&lt;ref name=noise/&gt; (sometimes thermal, Johnson or Nyquist noise) is unavoidable, and generated by the random thermal motion of charge carriers (usually [[electron]]s), inside an [[electrical conductor]], which happens regardless of any applied [[voltage]].

Thermal noise is approximately [[white noise|white]], meaning that its [[power spectral density]] is nearly equal throughout the [[frequency spectrum]]. The amplitude of the signal has very nearly a [[Gaussian]] [[probability density function]]. A communication system affected by thermal noise is often modeled as an [[additive white Gaussian noise]] (AWGN) channel.

The [[root mean square]] (RMS) voltage due to thermal noise &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt;, generated in a resistance ''R'' ([[ohms]]) over bandwidth Δ''f'' ([[hertz]]), is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
v_{n} = \sqrt{ 4 k_B T R \Delta f }
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] ([[joule]]s per [[kelvin]]) and ''T'' is the resistor's absolute [[temperature]] (kelvin).

As the amount of thermal noise generated depends upon the temperature of the circuit, very sensitive circuits such as [[preamplifier]]s in [[radio telescope]]s are sometimes cooled in [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce the noise level.

===Shot noise===
{{Main|Shot noise}}

Shot noise in electronic devices results from unavoidable random statistical fluctuations of the [[electric current]] when the charge carriers (such as [[electron]]s) traverse a gap. The current is a flow of discrete charges, and the fluctuation in the arrivals of those charges creates shot noise. Shot noise is similar to the noise created by rain falling on a tin roof. The flow of rain may be relatively constant, but the raindrops arrive discretely.

The root-mean-square value of the shot noise current ''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the Schottky formula
:&lt;math&gt;i_n = \sqrt{2 I q \Delta B} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the DC current, ''q'' is the charge of an electron, and ''&amp;Delta;B'' is the bandwidth in hertz.

The shot noise assumes independent arrivals. [[Vacuum tube]]s have shot noise because the electrons randomly leave the cathode and arrive at the anode (plate). A tube may not exhibit the full shot noise effect: the presence of a [[space charge]] tends to smooth out the arrival times (and thus reduce the randomness of the current).

Conductors and resistors do not have shot noise because they do not have a gap.

===Flicker noise===
{{Main|Flicker noise}}
Flicker noise, also known as 1/''f'' noise, is a signal or process with a [[frequency spectrum]] that falls off steadily into the higher frequencies, with a [[pink noise|pink]] spectrum. It occurs in almost all electronic devices, and results from a variety of effects, though always related to a direct current.
===Intermodulation noise===
This type of noise is caused when signals of different frequencies share the same medium.

===Crosstalk===
This is unwanted coupling of signals.
===Impulse noise===
short peak of noise example Lightning, electrical disturbances,flaws in communication system

===Interference===
Contamination by various signals from human sources example Power lines transmitters
It does not disappear when signal is switched off.
===Burst noise===
{{Main|Burst noise}}
Burst noise consists of sudden step-like transitions between two or more levels (non-[[Gaussian]]), as high as several hundred [[microvolt]]s, at random and unpredictable times. Each shift in offset voltage or current lasts for several milliseconds, and the intervals between pulses tend to be in the [[Audio frequencies|audio]] range (less than 100 [[hertz|Hz]]), leading to the term ''popcorn noise'' for the popping or crackling sounds it produces in audio circuits.

===Transit-time noise===
If the time taken by the electrons from traveling from emitter to collector becomes comparable to the period of the signal being amplified, that is, at frequencies above [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and beyond, so-called transit-time effect takes place and noise input [[admittance]] of the [[transistor]] increases. From the frequency at which this effect becomes significant it goes on increasing with frequency and quickly dominates over other terms.

===Avalanche noise===
Avalanche noise is the noise produced when a junction diode is operated at the onset of [[avalanche breakdown]], a [[semiconductor junction]] phenomenon in which carriers in a high voltage gradient develop sufficient energy to dislodge additional carriers through physical impact, creating ragged current flows.

==Coupled noise==
{{See also|Electromagnetic compatibility}}
[[Energy]] external of the receiver can couple noise, also by [[energy conversion]]. Generally this is done by [[fundamental interaction]], in electronics mainly by [[Inductive coupling]] and/or [[capacitive coupling]].

===Atmospheric noise (static noise)===
{{Main|Atmospheric noise}}
This noise is also called static noise and it is the natural source of disturbance caused by [[lightning]] discharge of in thunderstorm and the natural(electrical) disturbances occurring in the nature.

===Industrial noise===
Sources such as automobiles, aircraft, ignition electric motors and switching gear, High [[voltage]] wires and [[fluorescent lamp]]s cause industrial noise. These noises are produced by the discharge present in all these operations.

===Extraterrestrial noise===
Noise from outside the Earth include:

====Solar noise====
The noise which has its source in the disturbance of [[Sun]] is called solar noise. Under normal conditions there is constant [[radiation]] from sun due to its high temperature. Electrical disturbances also create noise such as [[corona discharge]]. [[Sunspot]]s also produce noise.

====Cosmic noise====
{{Main|Cosmic noise}}
Distant stars also generate noise called cosmic noise. Since these stars are far away so individual effect is not sufficient to generate a noise which disturb our [[Communications system]] but as they are large in number so collective effect makes noise in air appreciable.  The effect of cosmic noise has been observed from 8Mhz to 1.43Ghz.

=== Reduction of noise coupling===

In many cases noise found on a signal in a circuit is unwanted. When creating a circuit, one usually wants a true output of what the circuit has accomplished. There are many different noise reduction techniques that can change a noisy altered output signal to a more theoretical output signal.

#Faraday cage – A [[Faraday cage]] is a good way to reduce the overall noise in a complete circuit. The Faraday cage can be thought of as an enclosure that separates the complete circuit from outside power lines and any other signal that may alter the true signal. A Faraday cage will usually block out most electromagnetic and electrostatic noise.
#Capacitive coupling – A current through two resistors, or any other type of conductor, close to each other in a circuit can create unwanted [[capacitive coupling]]. If this happens an AC signal from one part of the circuit can be accidentally picked up in another part. The two resistors (conductors) act like a capacitor thus transferring AC signals. There may be other reasons for which capacitive coupling is wanted but then it would not be thought of as electronic noise.
#Ground loops – When grounding a circuit, it is important to avoid [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]]. Ground loops occur when there is a voltage drop between the two ground potentials. Since ground is thought of as 0V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a ground bus. If this is the case, it would not be a true ground. A good way to fix this is to bring all the ground wires to the same potential in a ground bus.
#Shielding cables – In general, using [[shielded cable]]s to protect the wires from unwanted noise frequencies in a sensitive circuit is good practice. A shielded wire can be thought of as a small Faraday cage for a specific wire as it uses a plastic or rubber enclosing the true wire. Just outside of the rubber/plastic covering is a conductive metal that intercepts any noise signal. Because the conductive metal is grounded, the noise signal runs straight to ground before ever getting to the true wire. It is important to ground the shield at only one end to avoid a ground loop on the shield.
#Twisted pair wiring – [[Twisted pair|Twisting wires]] very tightly together in a circuit will dramatically reduce electromagnetic noise. Twisting the wires decreases the loop size in which a magnetic field can run through to produce a current between the wires. Even if the wires are twisted very tightly, there may still be small loops somewhere between them, but because they are twisted the magnetic field going through the smaller loops induces a current flowing in opposite ways in each wire and thus cancelling them out.
#Notch filters – Notch filters or [[Band-stop filter|band-rejection filters]] are essential when eliminating a specific noise frequency.  For example, in most cases the power lines within a building run at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. Sometimes a sensitive circuit will pick up this 60&amp;nbsp;Hz noise through some unwanted antenna (could be as simple as a wire in the circuit). Running the output through a notch filter at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz will amplify the desired signal without amplifying the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz noise. So in a sense the noise will be lost at the output of the filter.

==Quantification==
The '''noise level''' in an electronic system is typically measured as an electrical [[Power (physics)|power]] ''N'' in [[watt]]s or [[decibel|dBm]], a [[root mean square]] (RMS) voltage (identical to the noise [[standard deviation]]) in volts, [[decibel|dBμV]] or a [[mean squared error]] (MSE) in volts squared. Noise may also be characterized by its [[probability distribution]] and [[noise spectral density]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') in watts per hertz.

A noise signal is typically considered as a linear addition to a useful information signal. Typical signal quality measures involving noise are [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR or ''S''/''N''), [[signal-to-quantization noise ratio]] (SQNR) in [[Analog to digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] and compression, [[peak signal-to-noise ratio]] (PSNR) in image and video coding, [[Eb/N0|''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] in digital transmission, [[carrier to noise ratio]] (CNR) before the detector in carrier-modulated systems, and [[noise figure]] in cascaded amplifiers.

Noise is a random process, characterized by [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] properties such as its [[variance]], [[Probability distribution|distribution]], and [[spectral density]]. The spectral distribution of noise can vary with [[frequency]], so its power density is measured in watts per hertz (W/Hz). Since the power in a [[resistor|resistive]] element is proportional to the square of the voltage across it, noise voltage (density) can be described by taking the square root of the noise power density, resulting in volts per root hertz (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{V}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;). [[Integrated circuit]] devices, such as [[operational amplifiers]] commonly quote [[equivalent input noise]] level in these terms (at room temperature).

Noise power is measured in watts or [[decibel]]s (dB) relative to a standard power, usually indicated by adding a suffix after dB. Examples of electrical noise-level measurement units are [[dBu]], [[dBm0]], [[dBrn]], [[dBrnC]], and dBrn(''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), dBrn(144-[[line (electrical engineering)|line]]).

Noise levels are usually viewed in opposition to [[signal level]]s and so are often seen as part of a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). Telecommunication systems strive to increase the ratio of signal level to noise level in order to effectively transmit data. In practice, if the transmitted signal falls below the level of the noise (often designated as the [[noise floor]]) in the system, data can no longer be decoded at the receiver. Noise in telecommunication systems is a product of both internal and external sources to the system.

==Dither==
If the noise source is correlated with the signal, such as in the case of [[quantisation error]], the intentional introduction of additional noise, called [[dither]], can reduce overall noise in the bandwidth of interest. This technique allows retrieval of signals below the nominal detection threshold of an instrument. This is an example of [[stochastic resonance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1783">A '''stopband''' is a [[Band (radio)|band]] of frequencies, between specified limits, through which a [[electrical circuit|circuit]], such as a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] or [[telephone]] circuit, does not allow signals to pass, or the attenuation is above the required stopband attenuation level. Depending on application, the required attenuation within the stopband may typically be a value between 20 and 120 [[decibel|dB]] higher than the nominal passband attenuation, which often is 0 dB.

The lower and upper ''limiting frequencies'', also denoted lower and upper stopband [[corner frequency|corner frequencies]], are the frequencies where the stopband and the [[transition band]]s meet in a filter specification. The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency). 

A band-stop filter has one stopband, specified by two non-zero and non-infinite corner frequencies. The difference between the limits in the band-stop filter is the stopband [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], which usually is expressed in [[hertz]]. 

A bandpass filter typically has two stopbands. The shape factor of a bandpass filter is the relationship between the 3dB bandwidth, and the difference between the stopband limits.

A '''thermopile''' is an electronic device that converts [[thermal energy]] into [[electrical energy]]. It is composed of several [[thermocouple]]s connected usually in [[series connection|series]] or, less commonly, in [[parallel connection|parallel]]. 

Thermopiles do not respond to absolute [[temperature]], but generate an output [[voltage]] proportional to a local temperature difference or temperature gradient.

Thermopiles are used to provide an output in response to temperature as part of a temperature measuring device, such as the [[infrared thermometer]]s widely used by medical professionals to measure body temperature. They are also used widely in [[heat flux sensor]]s (such as the [[Moll thermopile]] and Eppley [[pyrheliometer]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novalynx.com/glossary-t.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume1/glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vibanalysis.co.uk/infrared/infrared%20glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt; and gas burner safety controls.  The output of a thermopile is usually in the range of tens or hundreds of millivolts.&lt;ref&gt;http://pisces.sdsu.edu/ONLINE_LESSONS/glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As well as increasing the signal level, the device may be used to provide spatial temperature averaging.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capgo.com/Resources/Sensors/SensorGlossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermopiles are also used to generate electrical energy from, for instance, heat from electrical components.

'''Transmissibility''' is the ratio of [[Input/output|output]] to [[Input/output|input]].

Transmissibility (T) = output/input

T&gt;1 means [[Amplifier|amplification]] and maximum amplification occurs when forcing [[frequency]] (''f''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) and natural frequency (''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) of the system coincide.

There is no unit designation for transmissibility, although it may sometimes be referred to as the &quot;Q&quot; factor.

The transmissibility is used in calculation of [[passive heave compensation ]] efficiency.

A '''variable-frequency drive''' ('''VFD''') (also termed ''adjustable-frequency drive'', ''variable-speed drive'', ''AC drive'', ''micro drive'' or ''[[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] drive'') is a type of [[adjustable-speed drive]] used in [[electro-mechanical]] drive systems to control [[AC motor]] [[speed]] and [[torque]] by varying motor input [[frequency]] and [[voltage]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book | first=Sylvester J. | last=Campbell | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1987 | title=Solid-State AC Motor Controls | edition= | publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc. | location=New York | isbn=0-8247-7728-X | pages= 79–189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaeschke&gt;{{cite book | first=Ralph L. | last=Jaeschke | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1978 | title=Controlling Power Transmission Systems | edition= | publisher=Penton/IPC | location=Cleveland, OH | id= |pages=210–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide&gt;{{cite book |last=NEMA Standards Publication |title= Application Guide for AC Adjustable Speed Drive Systems | year=2007 | url=http://www.nema.org/stds/acadjustable.cfm | accessdate=Mar 27, 2008| publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association (now The Association of Electrical Equipment and Medical Imaging Manufacturers)| location=Rosslyn, VA USA |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VFDs are used in applications ranging from small appliances to the largest of mine mill drives and compressors. However, about a third of the world's electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in fixed-speed [[centrifugal pump]], fan and compressor applications {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} and VFDs' global [[market penetration]] for all applications is still relatively small. This highlights especially significant energy efficiency improvement opportunities for retrofitted and new VFD installations.
	
Over the last four decades, [[power electronics]] technology has reduced VFD cost and size and improved performance through advances in semiconductor switching devices, drive topologies, simulation and control techniques, and control hardware and software.

VFDs are available in a number of different low and medium voltage [[AC/AC converter|AC-AC]] and DC-AC topologies.

== System description and operation ==

[[File:VFD System.png|right|thumb|320px|VFD system]]
A variable frequency drive is a device used in a drive system consisting of the following three main sub-systems:  AC motor, main drive [[controller (control theory)|controller]] assembly, and drive operator interface.&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaeschke, pp. 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AC Motor ===
The AC electric motor used in a VFD system is usually a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[induction motor]]. Some types of [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] motors can be used, but three-phase motors are usually preferred. Various types of [[synchronous motor]]s offer advantages in some situations, but three phase induction motors are suitable for most purposes and are generally the most economical motor choice. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance to such requirements as Part 31 of [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] Standard MG-1.&lt;ref&gt;NEMA Guide, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controller ===
The VFD controller is a [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] power electronics conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a [[rectifier]] bridge converter, a [[direct current]] (DC) link, and an inverter. [[Voltage source|Voltage-source]] inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) are by far the most common type of drives. Most drives are [[AC/AC Converter|AC-AC]] drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or [[Solar energy|solar]] applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, [[Full-wave rectifier|full-wave]] [[diode bridge]]. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a [[capacitor]] which smooths out the converter's DC output [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-[[sine wave|sinusoidal]] AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher [[power factor]] and lower [[harmonic distortion]] than [[Phase fired controllers|phase-controlled]] [[current source|current-source]] inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a [[phase converter]] having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Controller advances have exploited dramatic increases in the voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid state power devices over the past six decades. Introduced in 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose (2006)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Power Electronics and Motor Drives : Advances and Trends|year=2006|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-088405-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) has in the past two decades come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Bartos | first =Frank J. | title =AC Drives Stay Vital for the 21st Century | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Sep 1, 2004|accessdate =Mar 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first =Robert E. | last = Eisenbrown | title = AC Drives, Historical and Future Perspective of Innovation and Growth | booktitle = Keynote Presentation for the 25th Anniversary of The Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) | pages =6–10 | publisher =WEMPEC | date =May 18, 2008   | location = University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA | accessdate =Mar 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Jahn   | first =Thomas M. | coauthors =Owen, Edward L. | title =AC Adjustable-Speed Drives at the Millennium: How Did We Get Here? | journal =IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages =17–25 | publisher =IEEE | date =Jan 2001  | doi =10.1109/63.903985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In variable-[[torque]] applications suited for Volts per Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics require that the voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a [[linearity|linear]] V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460 volt, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz motors this linear V/Hz relationship is  460/60 = 7.67 V/Hz. While suitable in wide ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in [[quadratic function|quadratic]] V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.&lt;ref name=BasicsACDrive&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics of AC drives|url=http://www3.sea.siemens.com/step/flash/STEPACDrives/index.htm|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|page=Hardware-Part 2: slide 2 of 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose (1980)&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Bimal K. | last=Bose | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1980 | title=Adjustable Speed AC Drive Systems | edition= | publisher=IEEE Press | location=New York | isbn=0-87942-146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two other drive control platforms, [[vector control (motor)|vector control]] and [[direct torque control]] (DTC), adjust the motor voltage magnitude, angle from reference and frequency&lt;ref name=&quot;Yano&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Yano|first=Masao et al.|title=History of Power Electronics for Motor Drives in Japan|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/4/49/Yano2.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to precisely control the motor's magnetic flux and mechanical torque.

Although [[space vector modulation|space vector]] [[pulse-width modulation]] (SVPWM) is becoming increasingly popular,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose (2011)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Energy Scenario and Impact on Power Electronics In the 21st Century|url=http://www.peia2011.com/downloads/Bose_fullpaper.pdf|booktitle=PEIA 2011 - Workshop on Power Electronics for Insdustrial Applicationa and Renewable Energy Conversion|page=12|location=Doha,Qatar |accessdate=Feb 8, 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier frequency signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency as well as in voltage (or current).&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose 2006, p. 183&quot;&gt;Bose (2006), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation of the motors above rated nameplate speed (base speed) is possible, but is limited to conditions that do not require more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called &quot;field weakening&quot; and, for AC motors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. [[Permanent magnet]] synchronous motors have quite limited field weakening speed range due to the constant magnet [[flux linkage]]. Wound rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100&amp;nbsp;hp, 460 V, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1775 [[RPM]] (4 pole) induction motor supplied with 460 V, 75&amp;nbsp;Hz (6.134 V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75 RPM) = 100% power.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (1980), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At higher speeds the induction motor torque has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque{{efn|NEMA Guide defines a) Motor's breakaway torque as 'The torque that a motor produces at zero speed when operating on a control', and, b) Motor's breakdown torque as ' The breakdown torque of a motor is the maximum torque that it will develop with rated voltage applied at rated frequency on sinewave power, without an abrupt drop in speed.'}} of the motor. Thus rated power can be typically produced only up to 130...150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives often 200...300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.

An [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microprocessor]] governs the overall operation of the VFD controller. Basic [[Computer programming|programming]] of the microprocessor is provided as user inaccessible [[firmware]]. User programming of [[display device|display]], variable and function block parameters is provided to control, protect and monitor the VFD, motor and driven equipment.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Programming: slide 3 of 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic drive controller can be configured to selectively include such optional power components and accessories as follows: 
* Connected upstream of converter - [[circuit breaker]] or [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s, isolation [[contactor]], [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] filter, line [[inductor|reactor]], passive filter
* Connected to DC link - [[braking chopper]], braking [[resistor]]
* Connected downstream of inverter -  output reactor, sine wave filter, dV/dt filter.{{efn|The mathematical symbol dV/dt, defined as the [[derivative]] of voltage V with time t, provides a measure of rate of voltage rise, the maximum admissible value of which expresses the capability of capacitors, motors and other affected circuit elements to withstand high current or voltage spikes due to fast voltage changes; dV/dt is usually expressed in V/microsecond.&lt;ref name=EPCOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Film capacitors - Short Definition of Terms|url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/FilmCapacitors/PDF/PDF__DefinitionOfTerms,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_DefinitionOfTerms.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Hardware - Part 2: slide 7 of 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operator interface ===
The operator interface provides a means for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external [[process control]] signal. The operator interface often includes an [[alphanumeric]] display and/or indication lights and meters to provide information about the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided on the front of the VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with [[input/output|input and output]] (I/O) terminals for connecting pushbuttons, switches and other operator interface devices or control signals. A [[serial communications]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored and controlled using a computer.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaveland&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cleaveland | first =Peter | title = AC Adjustable Speed Drives | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Nov 1, 2007 | accessdate =Mar 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 107-129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drive operation ===
[[File:Four quadrant motion control of a motor.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Electric motor speed-torque chart]]
Referring to the accompanying chart, drive applications can be categorized as single-quadrant, two-quadrant or four-quadrant; the chart's four quadrants are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=TGN8&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical guide No. 8 - Electrical Braking|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6866afe6c69df93dc1257888004521e1/$file/abb_technical%20guide%20no.8_revb.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnergyRegen&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Regeneration|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/training_pdf/WBNR_ENERGY_REGENERATION.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Basics of AC Drives, pp. Hardware - Part 1: slides  9-10 of 11&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Quadrant I - Driving or motoring,&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 3&lt;/ref&gt; forward [[acceleration|accelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and torque 
* Quadrant II - Generating or braking, forward braking-[[deceleration|decelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and negative torque
* Quadrant III - Driving or motoring, reverse accelerating quadrant with negative speed and torque
* Quadrant IV - Generating or braking, reverse braking-decelerating quadrant with negative speed and positive torque.

Most applications involve single-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I, such as in variable-torque (e.g. centrifugal pumps or fans) and certain constant-torque (e.g. extruders) loads.

Certain applications involve two-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I and II where the speed is positive but the torque changes [[electrical polarity|polarity]] as in case of a fan decelerating faster than natural mechanical losses. Some sources define two-quadrant drives as loads operating in quadrants I and III where the speed and torque is same (positive or negative) polarity in both directions.

Certain high-performance applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) where the speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can only occur in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-[[Electromotive force|EMF]] and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In starting a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with [[Motor controller|direct on line starting]]. After the start of the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 95-102&lt;/ref&gt; However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low speed motor operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately-motorized fan ventilation.

With a VFD, the stopping sequence is just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque can be obtained by adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active-front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.

== Benefits ==

=== Energy savings ===
Many fixed-speed motor load applications that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy when they are operated at variable-speed, by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the loads' torque and power vary with the square and [[cube (algebra)|cube]], respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full speed power. This is in accordance with [[affinity laws]] that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.

In the United States, an  estimated 60-65% of electrical energy is used to supply motors, 75% of which are  variable torque fan, pump and compressor loads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose (2009b)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=The Past, Present, and Future of Power Electronics|journal=Industrial Electronics Magazine, IEEE|date=June 2009|volume=3|issue=2|page=9|doi=10.1109/MIE.2009.932709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen percent of the energy used in the 40 million motors in the U.S. could be saved by efficient energy improvement technologies such as VFDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spear (2005)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Spear|first=Mike|title=Adjustable Speed Drives: Drive Up Energy Efficiency|url=http://www.chemicalprocessing.com/articles/2005/489.html?page=1|publisher=ChemicalProcessing.com|accessdate=Jan 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose (2009a)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=B.

===Control performance===
AC drives are used to bring about process and quality improvements in industrial and commercial applications' acceleration, flow, monitoring, pressure, speed, temperature, tension and torque.&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC drives, p. Overview: slide 5 of 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed-speed operated loads subject the motor to a high starting torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending the life of the motor and the driven equipment.

Variable speed drives can also run a motor in specialized patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern can be applied to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.

Performance factors tending to favor use of DC, over AC, drives include such requirements as continuous operation at low speed, four-quadrant operation with regeneration, frequent acceleration and deceleration routines, and need for motor to be protected for hazardous area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABB (DC vs. AC)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=DC or AC Drives?

* '''Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drive topologies''' (see image):  In a VSI drive, the DC output of the [[diode]]-bridge converter stores energy in the capacitor bus to supply stiff voltage input to the inverter.

===Control platforms===
{{see also|Dqo transformation|Alpha–beta transformation}}
 
Most drives use one or more of the following control platforms:&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* PWM V/Hz [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] control
* PWM [[field-oriented control]] (FOC) or vector control
* Direct torque control (DTC).

===Load torque and power characteristics===
Variable frequency drives are also categorized  by the following load torque and power characteristics:
* Variable torque, such as in centrifugal fan, pump and blower applications
* Constant torque, such as in conveyor and displacement pump applications
* Constant power, such as in machine tool and traction applications.

=== Available power ratings ===
VFDs are available with voltage and current ratings covering a wide range of single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690&amp;nbsp;V. While motor-application LV drives are available in ratings of up to the order of 5 or 6 MW,&lt;ref name=ACS800Catalog&gt;{{cite journal | title = ACS800 Catalog - Single Drives 0.55 to 5600 kW| date =July 19, 2009 | accessdate =Mar 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic considerations typically favor medium voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings.

== Application considerations ==

=== AC line harmonics ===
Note of clarification:.{{efn|The harmonics treatment that follows is limited for simplication reasons to LV VSI-PWM drives.}}

While [[harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]] in the PWM output can easily be filtered by carrier frequency related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose 2006, p. 183&quot;/&gt; the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing [[nonlinear system|non-linear]] half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small in comparison to the large, stiff power system available from the [[electric power company]], the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the [[Electrical grid|AC grid]] can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low voltage networks, harmonics caused by single phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen (2000)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Hansen|coauthors=Neilsen, Peter; Blaabjerg, Frede|title=Harmonic Cancellation by Mixing Non-Linear Single-Phase and Three-Phase Loads|journal=IEEE Trans. on Industry Applications|date=Jan–Dec 2000|volume=36|issue=1|accessdate=Feb 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can have a negative impact on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.

When the power company's voltage becomes distorted due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This may lead to overheating and shorter operating life. Also [[Electrical substation|substation]] transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load may be required to install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high power installations harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technical Guide No. 6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Guide to Harmonics with AC Drives - Technical Guide No. 6| date =May 17, 2002 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6dff3290e5f2d651c125788d00393a58/$file/ABB_Technical%20guide%20No.6_REVC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), [[active rectification|active rectifier]], IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE) or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and suitable input reactor, AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus no braking resistor is needed and the efficiency of the drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.

Two other harmonics mitigation techniques exploit use of passive or active filters connected to a common bus with at least one VFD branch load on the bus. Passive filters involve the design of one or more [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] LC filter traps, each trap being tuned as required to a harmonic frequency (5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, . . . kq+/-1, where k=integer, q=pulse number of converter).&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE 519&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=IEEE Std 519 - IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems|year=1992|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.114370|accessdate=Apr 12, 2012|[publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common practice for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] or [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic to be no more than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 519, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier frequency pulsed output voltage of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the transmission line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line [[impedance (electrical)|impedance]] of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce [[overvoltage]]s equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1 times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings and eventual insulation failure.   Note that standards for three-phase motors rated 230 V or less adequately protect against such long lead overvoltages.  On 460 or 575 V systems and inverters with 3rd generation 0.1 microsecond rise time  IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about  50 m or 150 feet. Solutions to  overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter duty rated motors (that are rated 600 V to withstand pulse trains with rise time less than or equal to 0.1 microsecond, of 1,600 V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters.&lt;ref&gt;Skibinski, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak (2009)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=Peter|title=The Basics of Variable-Frequency Drives|url=http://ecmweb.com/power_quality/variable-frequency-drives-20090501/|publisher=EC&amp;M|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finlayson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finlayson|first=P.T.|title=Output filters for PWM drives with induction motors|date=Jan–Feb 1998|volume=4|issue=1|pages=46–52|journal=IEEE Industry Applications Mazagine}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz and is most noticeable at about 3&amp;nbsp;kHz. Note also that selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for AC drives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common mode voltage induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dt filter.

===Motor bearing currents===
{{main|Shaft voltage}}

PWM drives are inherently associated with high frequency common mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2007/022.html|pages=pp. 1–2| title=Bearings and Electricity Don't Match|year=2007|journal=PlantServices.com [Plant Services]|publisher=PtmanMedia|last=Yung|first=Chuck|location=Itasca, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these high frequency voltages find a path to earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race that can be seen as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the [[stray capacitance]] of the windings provides paths for high frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current.  Poor [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] of motor stators can lead to shaft ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high frequency bearing currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technical Guide No. 5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bearing Currents in Modern AC Drive Systems - Technical Guide No. 5| date =Dec 1, 1999 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/8c253c2417ed0238c125788f003cca8e/$file/abb_technical_guide_no5_revc.pdf | accessdate =June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention of high frequency bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, interruption of bearing currents, and filtering or damping of common mode currents. Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded, symmetrical-geometry power cable to supply the motor, installation of shaft grounding brushes, and conductive bearing grease.  Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic shielded induction motors.  Filtering and damping high frequency bearing, or, instead of using standard 2-level inverter drives, using either 3-level inverter drives or matrix converters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technical Guide No. 5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Proceedings of 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 2008 (OPTIM 2008)|last=Swamy|first=M.|coauthors=Kume, T.|title=Present State and a Futuristic Vision of Motor Drive Technology|date=May 2008|pages=XLV-LVI, Fig. 16|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inverter-fed motor cables' high frequency current spikes can interfere with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50&amp;nbsp;cm away from signal cables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technical Guide No. 3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = EMC Compliant Installation and Configuration for a Power Drive System - Technical Guide No. 3| date =Apr 11, 2008 | url =http://te-dep-epc.web.cern.ch/te-dep-epc/Infos/Conferences/EMC%20Workshop/ABBTechnicalGuideEMC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic braking===
{{see also|Dynamic braking|Regenerative braking}}
Torque generated by the drive causes the induction motor to run at [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a [[Electric generator|generator]], converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or [[braking chopper|braking DC chopper]] controls dissipation of this power as heat in a set of resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Dynamic braking wastes braking energy by transforming it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives  recover braking energy by injecting this energy on the AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is however relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Guide No. 8, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regenerative drives===
[[File:KIMO TRA U2 mL Gruppe.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Line regenerative variable frequency drives, showing capacitors (top cylinders) and inductors attached, which filter the regenerated power.]]
[[File:2010 Prius Regeneration.jpg|right|thumb|300px||Simplified Drive Schematic for a Popular EHV&lt;ref name=&quot;Olszewski (2011)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Olszewski|first=Mitch et al.|title=Evaluation of 2010 Toyota Prius Hybrid Electric Drive System|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5017/notes/OakRidge_2010Prius.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=26 September 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regenerative AC drives have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an ''overhauling'' load) and return it to the power system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[electronics]], a '''virtual ground''' (or '''virtual earth''') is a node of a circuit that is maintained at a steady reference potential, without being connected directly to the reference potential. In some cases the reference potential is considered to be that of the surface of the earth, and the reference node is called &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;earth&quot; as a consequence. 

The virtual ground concept aids circuit analysis in operational amplifier and other circuits and provides useful practical circuit effects that would be difficult to achieve in other ways. 

In [[circuit theory]], a [[Node_(circuits)|node]] may have any value of current or voltage but physical implementations of a virtual ground will have limitations of current handling ability and a non-zero [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] which may have practical side effects.

==Construction==
A [[voltage divider]], using two resistors, can be used to create a virtual ground node. If two voltage sources are connected in series with two resistors, it can be shown that the midpoint becomes a virtual ground if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{V_2}{V_1} = -\frac{R_2}{R_1} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:opampinverting.svg|right|thumb|280px|Op-amp inverting amplifier]]

An active virtual ground circuit is sometimes called a rail splitter. Such a circuit uses an [[op-amp]] or some other circuit element that has gain. Since an [[operational amplifier]] has very high [[open-loop gain]], the potential difference between its inputs tend to zero when a feedback network is implemented. To achieve a reasonable voltage at the output (and thus equilibrium in the system), the output supplies the inverting input (via the feedback network) with enough voltage to reduce the potential difference between the inputs to microvolts. The non-inverting (+) input of the operational amplifier is grounded; therefore, its inverting (-) input, although not connected to ground, will assume a similar potential, becoming a ''virtual ground'' if the opamp is working in its linear region (i.e., outputs have not saturated).

== Applications ==

[[Voltage]] is a differential quantity, which appears between two points. In order to deal only with a voltage (an [[electrical potential]]) of a single point, the second point has to be connected to a reference point ([[Ground (electricity)|ground]]). Usually, the power supply terminals serve as steady grounds; when the internal points of compound power sources are accessible, they can also serve as real grounds.

If there are not accessible source internal points, external circuit points having steady voltage with respect to the source terminals can serve as artificial ''virtual grounds''. Such a point has to have steady potential, which does not vary when a load is attached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tangentsoft.net/elec/vgrounds.html Virtual Ground Circuits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/SingleSupply/SingleSupply.html Single Supply Op Amps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/29-3/consider.html Designing Single Supply, Low-Power Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">'''Voltage [[Droop (control)#Droop|droop]]''' is the intentional loss in output [[voltage]] from a device as it drives a load. Employing droop in a [[Voltage regulator|voltage regulation circuit]] increases the headroom for load [[Transient (oscillation)|transients]].

Although it may seem counterproductive, a series resistor is included between the regulator output and the load. The resistance needs to be chosen so that at maximum output current, the output voltage at the load is the minimum acceptable. Conversely, when the output current is (near) zero, the voltage is near the maximum. This follows simply from [[Ohm's law]]. The behaviour of the system with and without the added droop resistor is as follows:

[[Image:Droop behaviour.png]]

In a regulator not employing droop, when the load is suddenly increased very rapidly (i.e. a transient), the output voltage will momentarily sag. Conversely, when a heavy load is suddenly disconnected, the voltage will show a peak. The output decoupling capacitors have to &quot;absorb&quot; these transients before the loop has a chance to compensate. A diagram of such transients is shown below. The maximum allowed voltage swing in such a transient is &lt;math&gt;V_{max} - V_{nom}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Regulator no droop.png]]

Comparing this to a regulator with droop, we find that the maximum allowed swing has doubled: it is now &lt;math&gt;V_{max} - V_{min}&lt;/math&gt;. This increased tolerance to transients allows us to decrease the number of output capacitors, or get better regulation with the same number of capacitors.

In [[electrical engineering]], particularly [[power engineering]], '''voltage regulation''' is a measure of change in the [[voltage]] magnitude between the sending and receiving end of a component, such as a [[transmission line|transmission]] or distribution line. Voltage regulation describes the ability of a system to provide near constant voltage over a wide range of [[Electrical load|load]] conditions. The term may refer to a passive property that results in more or less voltage drop under various load conditions, or to the active intervention with devices for the specific purpose of adjusting voltage.

==Electrical power systems==
In electrical power systems it is a [[dimensionless quantity]] defined at the receiving end of a transmission line as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Percent } VR = \frac{|V_{nl}| - |V_{fl}|}{|V_{fl}|} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Stephen J.|title=Electric Machinery Fundamentals|year=2005|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-246523-5|pages=100, 263.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where
''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is voltage at no load and ''V&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;'' is voltage at full load.  A smaller value of ''Voltage Regulation'' is usually beneficial.

The Voltage Regulation formula could be visualized with the following: &quot;Consider power being delivered to a load such that the voltage at the load is the load's rated voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;Rated&lt;/sub&gt;'', if then the load disappears, the voltage at the point of the load will rise to ''V&lt;sub&gt;nl&lt;/sub&gt;''.&quot;

Sometimes, the term voltage regulation is used to describe processes by which the quantity ''VR'' is reduced, especially concerning special circuits and devices for this purpose (see below).

==Electronic power supply parameters==
The quality of a system's voltage regulation is described by three main parameters:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Parameter
! Symbol
! Description
|-
| [[Line regulation]]
| S&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;
| Measure of the ability to maintain a constant output voltage, regardless of changes to the input voltage
|-
| [[Load regulation]]
| R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
| Measure of the ability to maintain a constant output voltage, regardless of the size of the system's load
|-
| Temperature dependence
| S&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;
| Measure of the ability to maintain a constant output voltage, regardless of variations in temperature of electrical components within the system, especially semiconductor based devices.
|}

== Distribution feeder regulation ==
[[electric utility|Electric utilities]] aim to provide service to customers at a specific voltage level, for example, 220V or 240V. However, due to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]], the voltage magnitude and thus the service voltage to customers will in fact vary along the length of a conductor such as a distribution feeder (see [[Electric power distribution]]). Depending on law and local practice, actual service voltage within a tolerance band such as ±5% or ±10% may be considered acceptable. In order to maintain voltage within tolerance under changing load conditions, various types of devices are traditionally employed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Meier|first=Alexandra|title=Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0471178594|pages=184–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

• a [[tap changer|load tap changer]] (LTC) at the substation [[transformer]], which changes the turns ratio in response to load current and thereby adjusts the voltage supplied at the sending end of the feeder;

• [[voltage regulator]]s, which are essentially transformers with [[tap changer]]s to adjust the voltage along the feeder, so as to compensate for the voltage drop over distance; and

• [[capacitor]]s, which reduce the voltage drop along the feeder by reducing current flow to loads consuming [[reactive power]].

A new generation of devices for voltage regulation based on [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state technology]] are in the early commercialization stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greentechmedia article on voltage-correcting grid sensor|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/varentec-launches-the-distributed-voltage-correcting-grid-sensor|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution regulation involves a &quot;regulation point&quot;: the point at which the equipment tries to maintain constant voltage. Customers further than this point observe an expected effect: higher voltage at light load, and lower voltage at high load. Customers closer than this point experience the opposite effect: higher voltage at high load, and lower voltage at light load.

'''X-parameters''' are a mathematical superset of S-parameters and are used for characterizing the amplitudes and relative phase of harmonics generated by nonlinear components under large input power levels.

==Description==

&lt;/ref&gt;)

X-parameters are applicable to both [[Large-signal model|large-signal]] and [[Small-signal model|small-signal]] conditions, for linear and nonlinear components.  They are a mathematical superset of [[Scattering parameters|S-parameters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = May 4, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that, in the limit of a small signal, Agilent’s X-parameters reduce to S-parameters.

They help overcome a key challenge in [[RF engineering]], namely that nonlinear [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] differences, [[Frequency mixer|harmonic mixing]], and nonlinear reflection effects occur when components are cascaded under large signal operating conditions. This means that there is a nonlinear and as such non-trivial relationship between the properties of the individual cascaded components and the composite properties of the resulting cascade. This situation is unlike that at [[Direct current|DC]], where one can simply add the values of [[resistor]]s connected in series. X-parameters help solve this cascading problem: if the X-parameters of a set of components are measured individually, the X-parameters (and hence the non-linear transfer function) can be calculated of any cascade made from them. Calculations based on X-parameters are usually performed within a harmonic balance simulator environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[communication]]s and [[electronics]], especially in [[telecommunications]], '''interference''' is anything which alters, modifies, or disrupts a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] as it travels along a [[channel (communications)|channel]] between a [[communication source|source]] and a receiver. The term typically refers to the addition of unwanted signals to a useful signal. Common examples are:

* [[Electromagnetic interference]] (EMI)
* [[Co-channel interference]] (CCI), also known as [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]
* [[Adjacent-channel interference]] (ACI)
* [[Intersymbol interference]] (ISI)
* [[Inter-carrier interference]] (ICI), caused by doppler shift in [[OFDM]] modulation (multitone modulation).

In electronics, '''derating''' (or de-rating or de-tuning) is the operation of a [[electronic device|device]] at less than its rated maximum power in order to prolong its life.

==In electronics==
[[Image:Derating curve.gif|thumb|right|245px|Derating curve of a hypothetical power device.]]
Power electronic devices have a maximum power dissipation rating usually quoted at a case temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}}. The datasheet for the device also includes a ''derating curve'' which indicates how much a device will dissipate without getting damaged at any given case temperature and this must be taken into account while designing a system. 

As can be seen from the derating curve image for a hypothetical [[bipolar junction transistor]], the device (rated for 100 W at {{convert|25|C|F}}) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after [[heat sink|heat-sinking]]) is {{convert|65|C|F}}. This final case temperature is a function of the [[Thermal resistance in electronics|thermal resistance]] between the device's case and the heat-sink; and the heat-sink and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics).

==In electrical installations==
All [[dimmer]]s rely on heat conduction and convection to keep the electronic components cool.  Similarly, power wiring (e.g., house wiring) not surrounded by an air space (e.g., inside a conduit) needs to have its current-limiting device (e.g. circuit breaker or fuse) adjusted so as not to carry as much current through that circuit. Derating is the reduction of the maximum capacity (load) a unit can reliably handle when [[Heat_sink#Fin_arrangements|fin]]s/side sections are removed.

[[File:Electronic-hydraulic analogy.svg|thumb|300px|Analogy between an hydraulic circuit (left) and an electronic circuit (right).]]

The electronic&amp;ndash;'''hydraulic analogy''' (derisively referred to as the '''drain-pipe theory''' by [[Oliver Lodge]]) &lt;ref&gt;  Paul J. Nahin, ''Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age'', JHU Press, 2002 
ISBN 0801869099 page 59 &lt;/ref&gt; is the most widely used analogy for &quot;electron fluid&quot; in a metal conductor.  Since [[electric current]] is invisible and the processes at play in [[electronics]] are often difficult to demonstrate, the various [[electronic component]]s are represented by [[hydraulic]] equivalents.  Electricity (as well as [[heat current|heat]]) was originally understood to be a kind of [[fluid]], and the names of certain electric quantities (such as [[Electric current|current]]) are derived from hydraulic equivalents.  As all analogies, it demands an intuitive and competent understanding of the baseline [[paradigm]]s (electronics and hydraulics).

==Paradigms==
There is no unique paradigm for establishing this analogy.  Two paradigms can be used to introduce the concept to students:
* Version with pressure induced by gravity. Large tanks of water are held up high, or are filled to differing water levels, and the potential energy of the water [[Head (hydraulic)|head]] is the pressure source.  This is reminiscent of electrical diagrams with an up arrow pointing to +V, grounded pins that otherwise are not shown connecting to anything, and so on.  This has the advantage of associating [[electric potential]] with [[gravitational potential]].
* Completely enclosed version with pumps providing pressure only; no gravity.  This is reminiscent of a circuit diagram with a voltage source shown and the wires actually completing a circuit.  This paradigm is further discussed below.

Other paradigms highlight the similarities between equations governing the flow of fluid and the flow of charge:
* Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in both steady and transient fluid flow situations with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akers, M. Gassman, &amp; R. Smith, ''Hydraulic Power System Analysis''. Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, 2006, Chapter 13, 
ISBN 0-8247-9956-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Esposito, &quot;A Simplified Method for Analyzing Circuits by Analogy&quot;. Machine Design, October 1969, pp. 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A slightly different paradigm is used in acoustics, where [[acoustic impedance]] is defined as a relationship between pressure and air speed.  In this paradigm, a large cavity with a hole is analogous to a capacitor that stores compressional energy when the time-dependent pressure deviates from atmospheric pressure. A hole (or long tube) is analogous to an inductor that stores kinetic energy associated with the flow of air.  &lt;ref&gt;Schelleng, John C. &quot;The violin as a circuit.&quot; The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 35.3 (2005): 326-338. http://www.maestronet.com/forum/index.php?app=core&amp;module=attach&amp;section=attach&amp;attach_id=13435&lt;/ref&gt;
* A circuit was used to model feedback stabilization of a hydrodynamic plasma instability in a [[magnetic mirror]] &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Axial feedback stabilization of a flute mode in a simple mirror reactor, by M. A. Lieberman and and S. L. Wong, Plasma Physics, Vol. 19, pp. 745-55 (1977). The article contains an L-C circuit that is unstable because the &quot;capacitance&quot; is negative: http://iopscience.iop.org/0032-1028/19/8/005/pdf/0032-1028_19_8_005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In this application, the effort was to keep the plasma column centered by applying voltages to the plates, and except for the presence of turbulence and non-linear effects, the plasma was an actual electric circuit element (not really an analog).

==Hydraulic analogy with horizontal water flow==
===Voltage, current, and charge===
; [[Electric potential]] : In general, this is equivalent to [[hydraulic head]]. This model assumes that the water is flowing horizontally, so that the force of gravity can be ignored.  In this case electric potential is equivalent to [[pressure]].  The [[voltage]] (or [[voltage drop]] or ''potential difference'' is a difference in pressure between two points. Electric potential and voltage are usually measured in [[volts]].  
; [[Electric current|Current]] : Equivalent to a hydraulic [[volume flow rate]]; that is, the volumetric quantity of flowing water over time.  Usually measured in [[amperes]].
; [[Electric charge]] : Equivalent to a quantity of water.

===Basic circuit elements===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Pipe (Wire).svg|''[[electrical wiring|Conducting wire]]:''&amp;nbsp; a simple pipe.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Reduced Pipe (Resistor).svg|''[[Resistor]]:''&amp;nbsp;a constricted pipe.
File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5130-22.jpg|''Node in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchoff's junction rule]]:''&amp;nbsp;A [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]] filled with flowing water.
 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
; [[Wire|Conducting wire]]: A relatively wide pipe completely filled with water is equivalent to a piece of wire.  When comparing to a piece of wire, the pipe should be thought of as having semi-permanent caps on the ends.  Connecting one end of a wire to a circuit is equivalent to un-capping one end of the pipe and attaching it to another pipe.  With few exceptions (such as a high-voltage power source), a wire with only one end attached to a circuit will do nothing; the pipe remains capped on the free end, and thus adds nothing to the circuit.
; [[Resistor]] : A constriction in the bore of the pipe which requires more pressure to pass the same amount of water. All pipes have some resistance to flow, just as all wires have some resistance to current.
; Node (or junction) in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchoff's junction rule]] : A [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe tee]].  The net flow of water into a piping tee (filled with water) must equal the net flow out.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:CapacitorHydraulicAnalogyAnimation.gif|''[[Capacitor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a flexible diaphragm sealed inside a pipe.
File:Hydraulic inductor model.svg|''[[Inductor]]:''&amp;nbsp; a heavy paddle wheel or turbine placed in the current.
File:Axial compressor.gif|''[[voltage source|Voltage]] or [[current source|current]] source:'' &amp;nbsp;A dynamic pump with feedback control.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
; [[Capacitor]] : A tank with one connection at each end and a rubber sheet dividing the tank in two lengthwise&lt;ref&gt;http://amasci.com/emotor/cap1.html&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[hydraulic accumulator]]). When water is forced into one pipe, equal water is simultaneously forced out the other pipe, yet no water can penetrate the rubber diaphragm. Energy is stored by the stretching of the rubber. As more current flows &quot;through&quot; the capacitor, the back-pressure (voltage) becomes greater, thus current &quot;leads&quot; voltage in a capacitor. As the back-pressure from the stretched rubber approaches the applied pressure, the current becomes less and less. Thus capacitors &quot;filter out&quot; constant pressure differences and slowly varying, low-frequency pressure differences, while allowing rapid changes in pressure to pass through. &lt;!--Don't understand the next paragraph--&gt;
&lt;!--  Note that the device described will pass all changes in pressure &quot;through&quot; equally well, regardless of rate of change, just as an electrical capacitor will. Any device in series must obey (electrical) Kirchhoff's Current Law, or its hydraulic equivalent. 
Considering the &quot;filter&quot; action, a better and more exact analogy is the hydraulic accumulator &quot;pressure tank&quot;, as described, but with a closed, pressurized air bladder and only one water connection. Such accumulators are commonly used in hydraulic power systems exactly for the purpose of damping out pressure surges and &quot;hammers&quot; due to valves opening and closing. --&gt;
; [[Inductor]] : A heavy paddle wheel placed in the current. The [[mass]] of the wheel and the size of the blades restrict the water's ability to rapidly change its rate of flow (current) through the wheel due to the effects of [[inertia]], but, given time, a constant flowing stream will pass mostly unimpeded through the wheel, as it turns at the same speed as the water flow. The mass and surface area of the wheel and its blades are analogous to inductance, and friction between its axle and the axle bearings corresponds to the resistance that accompanies any non-superconducting inductor.&lt;br/&gt;An alternative inductor model is simply a long pipe, perhaps coiled into a spiral for convenience.  This fluid-inertia device is used in real life as an essential component of a [[hydraulic ram]].  The [[inertia]] of the water flowing through the pipe produces the inductance effect; inductors &quot;filter out&quot; rapid changes in flow, while allowing slow variations in current to be passed through.  The drag imposed by the walls of the pipe is somewhat analogous to parasitic resistance. &lt;br/&gt;In either model, the pressure difference (voltage) across the device must be present before the current will start moving, thus in inductors voltage &quot;leads&quot; current. As the current increases, approaching the limits imposed by its own internal friction and of the current that the rest of the circuit can provide, the pressure drop across the device becomes lower and lower.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;
; Ideal [[voltage source]] (ideal [[battery (electricity)|battery]]) or ideal [[current source]] : A [[gas compressor|dynamic pump]] with feedback control. A pressure meter on both sides shows that regardless of the current being produced, this kind of pump produces constant pressure difference.  If one terminal is kept fixed at ground, another analogy is a large body of water at a high elevation, sufficiently large that the drawn water does not affect the water level.  To create the analog of an ideal [[current source]], use a [[positive displacement pump]]: A current meter (little [[paddle wheel]]) shows that when this kind of pump is driven at a constant speed, it maintains a constant speed of the little paddle wheel.

===Other circuit elements===
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Electrionics Analogy - Pressure-activated valve (Transistor).svg|A pressure-actuated valve combined with a one-way check valve acts as a transistor.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Valve (Diodes comparison).svg|Like a one-way check valve, a diode blocks current that flows the wrong way.  Current that flows the right way goes through almost unchanged.
Image:Electrionics Analogy - Example Circuit.svg|A simple A/C circuit consisting of an oscillating pump, a &quot;diode&quot; valve, and a &quot;capacitor&quot; tank.  Any kind of motor could be used here to drive the pump, as long as it oscillates.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
; [[Diode]] : Equivalent to a one-way [[check valve]] with a slightly leaky valve seat.  As with a diode, a small pressure difference is needed before the valve opens.  And like a diode, too much  [[P-n junction#Reverse bias|reverse bias]] can damage or destroy the valve assembly.&lt;!-- &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt; --&gt; 
; [[Transistor]] : A valve in which a diaphragm, controlled by a low-current signal (either constant current for a [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] or constant pressure for a [[Field effect transistor|FET]]), moves a plunger which affects the current through another section of pipe.
; [[CMOS]] : A combination of two [[MOSFET]] transistors.  As the input pressure changes, the pistons allow the output to connect to either zero or positive pressure.
; [[Memristor]] : A [[needle valve]] operated by a flow meter.  As water flows through in the forward direction, the needle valve restricts flow more; as water flows the other direction, the needle valve opens further providing less resistance.&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Principle equivalents ==

; EM wave speed ([[velocity of propagation]]) : [[Speed of sound]] in water.  When a light switch is flipped, the electric wave travels very quickly through the wires.
; Charge flow speed ([[drift velocity]]) : Particle speed of water.  The moving charges themselves move rather slowly.
; [[Direct current|DC]] : Constant flow of water in a circuit of pipe
; [[Low frequency]] [[Alternating current|AC]] : Water oscillating back and forth in a pipe
; [[high frequency|Higher-frequency]] AC and [[transmission line]]s : [[Sound]] being transmitted through the water pipes: Be aware that this does not properly mirror the cyclical reversal of alternating electric current. As described, the fluid flow conveys pressure fluctations, but fluids *do not* reverse at high rates in hydraulic systems, which the above &quot;low frequency&quot; entry does accurately describe. A better concept (if sound waves are to be the phenomenon) is that of direct current with high-frequency &quot;ripple&quot; superimposed.
; Inductive spark : Used in [[induction coil]]s, similar to [[water hammer]], caused by the inertia of water

If the differential equations have the same form, the response will be similar .

== Limits to the analogy ==

If taken too far, the water analogy can create misconceptions.  For it to be useful, we must remain aware of the regions where electricity and water behave very differently.

; [[electromagnetic field|Fields]] ([[Maxwell equations]], [[Inductance]]): Electrons can push or pull other distant electrons via their fields, while water molecules experience forces only from direct contact with other molecules.  For this reason, waves in water travel at the speed of sound, but waves in a sea of charge will travel much faster as the forces from one electron are applied to many distant electrons and not to only the neighbors in direct contact.  In a hydraulic transmission line, the energy flows as mechanical waves through the water, but in an electric transmission line the energy flows as fields in the space surrounding the wires, and does not flow inside the metal.  Also, an accelerating electron will drag its neighbors along while attracting them, both because of magnetic forces.

; Charge :  Unlike water, movable charge carriers can be positive or negative, and conductors can exhibit an overall positive or negative net charge.  The mobile carriers in electric currents are usually electrons, but sometimes they are charged positively, such as [[hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ions]] in [[proton conductor]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] in [[p-type semiconductor]]s and some (very rare) conductors.

; Leaking pipes:  The [[electric charge]] of an electrical circuit and its elements is usually almost equal to zero, hence it is (almost) constant. This is formalized in [[Kirchhoff's current law]], which does not have an analogy to hydraulic systems, where amount of the liquid is not usually constant. Even with [[incompressible]] liquid the system may contain such elements as [[piston]]s and open pools, so the volume of liquid contained in a part of the system can change. For this reason, continuing electric currents require closed loops rather than hydraulics' open source/sink resembling spigots and buckets.

; Fluid velocity and resistance of metals :  As with water hoses, the carrier drift velocity in conductors is directly proportional to current.  However, water only experiences drag via the pipes' inner surface, while charges are slowed at all points within a metal.  Also, typical velocity of charge carriers within a conductor is less than centimeters per minute, and the &quot;electrical friction&quot; is extremely high.  If charges ever flowed as fast as water can flow in pipes, the electric current would be immense, and the conductors would become incandescently hot and perhaps vaporize.  To model the resistance and the charge-velocity of metals, perhaps a pipe packed with sponge, or a narrow straw filled with syrup, would be a better analogy than a large-diameter water pipe. Resistance in most electrical conductors is a linear function: as current increases, voltage drop increases proportionally (Ohm's Law). Liquid resistance in pipes is not linear with volume, varying as the square of volumetric flow (see [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]).

; [[Quantum Mechanics]] : Conductors and insulators contain charges at more than one [[Energy level|discrete level of atomic orbit energy]], while the water in one region of a pipe can only have a single value of pressure.  For this reason there is no hydraulic explanation for such things as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]'s charge pumping ability, a [[diode]]'s voltage drop, [[solar cell]] functions, [[Peltier effect]], etc., however equivalent devices can be designed which exhibit similar responses, although some of the mechanisms would only serve to regulate the flow curves rather than to contribute to the component's primary function.

Usefulness requires that the reader or student has a substantial understanding of the model (hydraulic) system's principles. It also requires that the principles can be transferred to the target (electrical) system. Hydraulic systems are deceptively simple: the phenomenon of [[Cavitation#Pumps_and_propellers|pump cavitation]] is a known, complex problem that few people outside of the fluid power or irrigation industries would understand. For those who do, the hydraulic analogy is amusing, as no &quot;cavitation&quot; equivalent exists in electrical engineering. The hydraulic analogy can give a mistaken sense of understanding that will be exposed once a detailed description of electrical circuit theory is required. 

One must also consider the difficulties in trying to make the analogy work. The above &quot;electrical friction&quot; example, where the hydraulic analog is a pipe filled with sponge material, illustrates the problem: the model must be increased in complexity beyond any realistic scenario.

{{distinguish|Spill (audio)}}
In [[electronics]], '''crosstalk''' ('''XT''') is any phenomenon by which a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] transmitted on one circuit or channel of a [[transmission system]] creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel. Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]], [[inductive coupling|inductive]], or [[conductive coupling]] from one [[electrical network|circuit]], part of a circuit, or [[channel (communications)|channel]], to another.

==In cabling==
In [[structured cabling]], crosstalk can refer to [[electromagnetic interference]] from one unshielded [[twisted pair]] to another twisted pair, normally running in parallel.

;Near end crosstalk (NEXT):  NEXT is a measure of the ability of cabling to reject crosstalk. Interference between two pairs in a cable measured at the same end of the cable as the interfering transmitter. Crosstalk is undesirable. In crosstalk, the signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire in twisted-pair cabling interfere with each other. The pair causing the interference is called the “disturbing pair,” while the pair experiencing the interference is the “disturbed pair.” Channel NEXT is the NEXT value measured between one wire pair and another in the same cable; NEXT is measured at both ends of the wire. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet. NEXT value varies with the frequency of transmission. The higher the NEXT value, the greater the cable’s ability to reject crosstalk at its local connection. Generally specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) include the minimum NEXT values.&lt;ref name=&quot;lanshack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx |title=Category 5 / 5E &amp; Cat 6 Cabling Tutorial and FAQ's |publisher=lanshack.com |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Power sum near end crosstalk (PSNEXT): A NEXT measurement which includes the sum of crosstalk contributions of all adjacent pairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;lanshack&quot;/&gt;

==Other examples==
In [[telecommunication]] or [[telephony]], crosstalk is often distinguishable as pieces of speech or [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] tones leaking from other people's connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/62gTIhztA Federal Standard 1037C glossary] Archived 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the connection is analog, [[twisted pair]] cabling can often be used to reduce the effects of crosstalk. Alternatively, the signals can be converted to digital form, which is much less susceptible to crosstalk.

In [[wireless communication]], crosstalk is often denoted [[co-channel interference]], and is related to [[adjacent-channel interference]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In [[integrated circuit design]], crosstalk normally refers to a signal affecting another nearby signal.  Usually the coupling is capacitive, and to the nearest neighbor, but other forms of coupling and effects on signal further away are sometimes important, especially in analog designs. See [[signal integrity]] for tools used to measure and prevent this problem, and [[substrate coupling]] for a discussion of crosstalk conveyed through the [[integrated circuit]] substrate. There are a wide variety of possible fixes, with increased spacing, wire re-ordering, and shielding being the most common.

In [[stereo]] audio reproduction crosstalk can refer to signal leaking across from one program channel to another. This is an electrical effect and can be quantified with a [[crosstalk measurement]].

In full-field optical coherence [[tomography]], &quot;crosstalk&quot; refers to the phenomenon that due to highly scattering objects, multiple scattered photons reach the image plane and generate coherent signal after traveling a pathlength that matches that of the sample depth within a coherence length.

In [[3D display|stereoscopic 3D displays]], &quot;crosstalk&quot; refers to the incomplete isolation of the left and right image channels so that one leaks or bleeds into the other - like a double exposure, which produces a [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] effect.

'''Coupling loss''' also known as connection loss is the loss that occurs when [[energy]] is transferred from one [[electrical circuit|circuit]], circuit element, or medium to another. Coupling loss is usually expressed in the same [[units of measurement|units]]—such as [[watt]]s or [[decibel]]s—as in the originating circuit element or medium.

Coupling loss in [[optical fiber|fiber optics]] refers to the power loss that occurs when coupling light from one optical device or medium to another. (See also [[Optical return loss]].)

Coupling losses can result from a number of factors.  In electronics (''see [[Coupling (electronics)]]''), [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]] between coupled components results in a [[Signal reflection|reflection]] of a portion of the energy at the interface.  Likewise, in optical systems, where there is a change in index of refraction (most commonly at a fiber/air interface), a portion of the energy is reflected back into the source component.  

Another major source of optical coupling loss is geometrical.  As an example, two fibers coupled end-to-end may not be precisely aligned, with the result that the two cores overlap somewhat.  Light exiting the source fiber at a portion of its core that is not aligned with the core of the receiving fiber will not (in general) be coupled into the second fiber.  While some such light will be coupled into the second fiber, it is not likely to be efficiently coupled, nor will it generally travel in an appropriate mode in the second fiber.  

Similarly, even for two perfectly aligned cores, where there is a gap of any significant distance between the two fibers, there will be some geometric loss due to spread of the beam.  Some percentage of the light rays exiting the source fiber face will not intersect the second fiber within its entrance cone.

[[File:Arduino ftdi chip-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Surface-mount technology|Surface mount]] electronic components]]
'''Electronics''' deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies. Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an [[electronic circuit]].  

The [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunication]], and [[signal processing]]. The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working [[system]].

Electronics is distinct from [[electricity|electrical]] and [[electro-mechanical]] science and technology, which deal with the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms using [[wire]]s, [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[switch]]es, [[relay]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[resistor]]s, and other [[passive component]]s. This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by [[Lee De Forest]] of the [[triode]], which made electrical [[Amplifier|amplification]] of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device. Until 1950 this field was called &quot;radio technology&quot; because its principal application was the design and theory of radio [[transmitter]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], and [[vacuum tube]]s.

Today, most electronic devices use [[semiconductor]] components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of [[solid-state physics]], whereas the design and construction of [[electronic circuit]]s to solve practical problems come under [[electronics engineering]]. This article focuses on [[engineering]] aspects of electronics.

== Electronic devices and components ==
{{main|Electronic component}}
An electronic component is any physical entity in an electronic system used to affect the [[electron]]s or their associated fields in a manner consistent with the intended function of the electronic system. Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[radio receiver]], or [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as [[integrated circuit]]s. Some common electronic components are [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc. Components are often categorized as active (e.g. transistors and [[thyristor]]s) or [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] (e.g. resistors and capacitors).

== Early electronic components ==
{{See|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}
[[Vacuum tube]]s (Thermionic valves) were one of the earliest electronic components. They dominated electronics until the middle of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Okamura1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sōgo Okamura|title=History of Electron Tubes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;pg=PR4|accessdate=5 December 2012|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-145-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, solid state devices have all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as [[valve RF amplifier|high power RF amplifiers]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, specialist audio equipment, [[guitar amplifiers]] and some [[cavity magnetron|microwave devices]].

== Types of circuits ==
Circuits and components can be divided into two groups: analog and digital. A particular device may consist of circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.

=== Analog circuits ===
{{Main|Analog electronics}}
[[File:HitachiJ100A.jpg|right|thumb|Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis]]
Most [[analog signal|analog]] electronic appliances, such as [[radio]] receivers, are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits. [[Analog circuits]] use a continuous range of voltage as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.

The number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge, especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.

Analog circuits are sometimes called [[linear circuit]]s although many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.

One rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog. These days analog circuitry may use digital or even microprocessor techniques to improve performance. This type of circuit is usually called &quot;mixed signal&quot; rather than analog or digital.

Sometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the comparator which takes in a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled [[switch]] having essentially two levels of output.

=== Digital circuits ===
{{Main|Digital electronics}}
Digital circuits are electric circuits based on a number of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most common physical representation of [[Boolean logic|Boolean algebra]], and are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers, the terms &quot;digital circuit&quot;, &quot;digital system&quot; and &quot;logic&quot; are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits.
Most digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labeled &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. Often logic &quot;0&quot; will be a lower voltage and referred to as &quot;Low&quot; while logic &quot;1&quot; is referred to as &quot;High&quot;.  However, some systems use the reverse definition (&quot;0&quot; is &quot;High&quot;) or are current based. [[Ternary computer|Ternary]] (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made.
[[Computer]]s, electronic [[quartz clock|clocks]], and [[programmable logic controller]]s (used to control industrial processes) are constructed of [[Digital data|digital]] circuits. [[Digital signal processor]]s are another example.

Building blocks:
* [[Logic gate]]s
* [[Adder (electronics)|Adders]]
* [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]]
* [[Counter]]s
* [[Processor register|Registers]]
* [[Multiplexer]]s
* [[Schmitt trigger]]s

Highly integrated devices:
* [[Microprocessor]]s
* [[Microcontroller]]s
* [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC)
* [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP)
* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)

== Heat dissipation and thermal management ==
{{Main|Thermal management of electronic devices and systems}}
[[Heat]] generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Techniques for heat dissipation can include [[heat sink]]s and [[Mechanical fan|fans]] for air cooling, and other forms of [[computer cooling]] such as [[water cooling]]. These techniques use [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], &amp; [[radiation]] of heat energy.

== Noise ==
{{Main|Electronic noise}}
Electronic noise is defined&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms ISBN 978-0-471-42806-0&lt;/ref&gt; as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the [[operating temperature]] of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as [[shot noise]] cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.

== Electronics theory ==
{{Main|Mathematical methods in electronics}}

Mathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics. To become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis.

Circuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain [[Node (circuits)|node]] or the current through a certain [[Path (graph theory)|branch]] of a [[Graph (mathematics)|network]]. A common analytical tool for this is the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator.

Also important to electronics is the study and understanding of [[electromagnetic field]] theory.

== Electronics lab ==
{{Main|Electronic circuit simulation}}

Due to the [[empirical]] nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the study of electronics.  These experiments are used to prove, verify, and reinforce laws and [[theorem]]s such as [[Ohm's law]], [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]], etc.  Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as [[CircuitLogix]], [[Multisim]], and [[PSpice]].

== Computer aided design (CAD) ==
{{Main|Electronic design automation}}

Today's electronics engineers have the ability to [[Circuit design|design]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] using premanufactured building blocks such as [[power supply|power supplies]], [[semiconductor]]s (such as [[transistor]]s), and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Electronic design automation]] software programs include [[schematic capture]] programs and [[printed circuit board]] design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence ([[ORCAD]]), [[EAGLE (program)|EAGLE]] PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.

== Construction methods ==
{{Main|Electronic packaging}}
Many different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used [[Point-to-point construction|point to point wiring]] with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. [[Printed circuit board#&quot;Cordwood&quot; construction|Cordwood construction]] and [[wire wrap]]s were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as [[FR-4|FR4]], or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper ([[SRBP]], also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) - characterised by its light yellow-to-brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to the European Union, with its [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE), which went into force in July 2006.

== Degradation ==

[[Rasberry crazy ant]]s have been known to consume the insides of electrical wiring, and nest inside of electronics; they prefer [[Direct current|DC]] to [[Alternating current|AC]] currents. This behavior is not well understood by scientists. &lt;ref&gt; {{citeweb|url=http://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/207800337/crazy-ant-invasion-frying-computer-equipment.htm|title='Crazy' Ant Invasion Frying Computer Equipment|author=Andrew R Hickey|date=May 15, 2008}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bandwidth pooling''' is used in [[network switch]]es to optimize the use of [[network resources]]. It allows switch processing cards to be shared by physical interface cards. This innovation frees switch resources that would otherwise be stranded when lower-rate interface cards are deployed in an aggregation switch.

'''Bandwidth Pooling in Dedicated Hosting:''' This is a key mechanism for hosting buyers to determine which provider is offering the right pricing mechanism of bandwidth pricing. Most Dedicated Hosting providers bundle bandwidth pricing along with the monthly charge for the dedicated server. Let us illustrate this with the help of an example. An average $100 server from any of the common dedicated bandwidth providers would carry 2 TB of bandwidth. Suppose you purchased 10 servers then you would have the ability to consume 2 TB of bandwidth per server. However, let us assume that given your application architecture only 2 of these 10 servers are really web facing while the rest are used for storage, search, database or other internal functions then the provider that allows bandwidth pooling would let you consume overall 20 TB of bandwidth as incoming or outbound or both depending on their policy. The provider that does not offer bandwidth pooling would just let you use 2 TB of bandwidth and the rest of the 18 TB of bandwidth would be practically unusable.

==Uses==

Bandwidth pooling is used in computer and mobile phone networks.

[[Image:Instrument Transformer HV terminals.jpg|thumb|180px|HV side with dot conventions]]
[[Image:Instrument Transformer LV terminals.jpg|thumb|180px|LV side with dot conventions]]
'''Instantaneous polarity''', commonly called '''polarity''' is an electrical term used to denote the relationship of mutual inductances to each other influencing their relative electrical phasing.  

A dot marking convention, or alphanumeric marking convention, or both, can be used to denote the same relative instantaneous '''[[Polarity (physics)|polarity]]''' of two [[Mutual_inductance#Coupled_inductors_and_mutual_inductance|mutually inductive]] components such as between [[transformer]] windings. These markings may be found on transformer cases beside terminals, winding leads, nameplates, schematic and wiring diagrams.

Based on the '''dot convention''', a current entering the dotted terminal of one coil, will induce positive voltage at the dotted terminal of the second coil. Alternatively, if the current leaves the dotted terminal of the coil, it will induce negative voltage at the dotted terminal of the second coil.{{sfn|Alexander|2009|p=559–560}}

==Transformer windings==
Two methods are commonly used to denote which terminals present the same relative polarity. A dot may be used, or an alphanumeric designation. Alphanumeric designations are typically in the form H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for primaries, and for secondaries, X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, (and Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, if more windings present).

Unlike single-phase transformers, three-phase transformers may incorporate a phase shift due to different winding configurations resulting in a multiple of 30 degree phase shift between H1 and X1 bushing designations.

==Terminal layout conventions==
Referring to the circuit diagrams below:
:The circuit polarity signs '+' and '-' indicate example applied and resultant, relative voltage polarities.
:The instantaneous polarities of the voltages across each inductor with respect to the dotted terminals are the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Relative polarities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PS-E-15 — Provisional Specifications for Approval of Electronic Voltage Transformers|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mc-mc.nsf/eng/lm00148.html#Section8.2|publisher=Measurement Canada|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

:The circuit arrows indicate example applied and resultant relative current directions.
:The instantaneous directions of the current entering the primary inductor at its dotted end and the current leaving of the secondary inductor at its dotted end are the same.

:'''Subtractive  polarity''' transformer designs are shown in the upper circuit diagrams.

[[Image:Mutual inductance.PNG]]

==Autotransformers==
If two mutually coupled inductors are in series, the dot convention can be used in the same manner as in the case of [[autotransformer]]s. Relative polarity in autotransformer drawings is usually quite obvious by physical placement of the windings in circuit drawings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">In electronics, a '''cut-off''' is a state of [[negligible]] [[electrical conduction|conduction]] which is a property of several types of [[electronic component]]s when a [[control parameter]] (which usually is a well-defined [[voltage]] or [[electric current]], but could also be an incident [[Intensity (physics)|light intensity]] or a [[magnetic field]]), is lowered or increased past a value (the conduction threshold). The transition from [[electrical conduction|normal conduction]] to cut-off can be more or less sharp, depending on the type of [[Electronic component|device]] considered, and also the [[speed]] of this transition varies considerably.

==Cutoff values==
===Diodes===
* Silicon diode: cutoff occurs when Vf falls below apx 0.7 V. The exact voltage varies with temperature.
* Germanium diode: apx 0.3 V, varying with temperature
* Schottky diode:
* Diac:
* Zener diode: reverse cutoff defined by diode voltage rating. Forward cutoff apx 0.6 V.
* Thermionic diode: cutoff voltage depends on device design. Much higher than for silicon devices.
* Copper oxide diode:
* Selenium diode:

===Transistors===
* Silicon transistor: apx 0.6 V, varying with temperature.
* Germanium transistor: apx 0.2 V, varying with temperature
* BJT:

* MOSFET:
* Triac:

==={{anchor|Tubes}}Valves===
* Triodes: triodes cut off when applied grid bias is too low. This will be a negative voltage under ordinary conditions.
* Tetrode, Pentode etc.: There is some degree of interaction between the grids, and values will vary from one device to another. Anode voltage also affects cutoff voltage.

'''Amplitude distortion''' is [[distortion]] occurring in a [[system]], subsystem, or device when the [[output]] amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions.  

Generally, output is a [[linear]] function of input only for a fixed portion of the transfer characteristics. In this region, I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=βI&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; where Ic is collector current and Ib is base current, following [[linear]] relation y=mx.

When output is not in this portion, two forms of amplitude distortion might arise
# harmonic distortion
# intermodulation distortion

; [[Harmonic distortion]] : The creation of [[harmonics]] of the [[fundamental frequency]] of a [[sine wave]] input to a system.

; [[Intermodulation distortion]] : This form of distortion occurs when two sine waves of frequencies ''X'' and ''Y'' are present at the input, resulting in the creation of several other frequency components, whose frequencies include (X+Y), (X-Y), (2X-Y), (2Y-X), and generally (mX ± nY) for integer m and n. Generally the size of the unwanted output falls rapidly as m and n increase.

Due to the additional outputs, this form of distortion is definitely unwanted in audio, radio and telecommunication amplifiers, and it occurs for more than two waves as well.

In a narrowband system such as a radio communication system, unwanted outputs such as X-Y and 2X+Y will be remote from the wanted band and so be ignored by the system. In contrast, 2X-Y and 2Y-X will be close to the wanted signals. These so-called third order distortion products (third order as m+n = 3) tend to dominante the non-linear distortion of narrowband systems.

Amplitude distortion is measured with the system operating under steady-state conditions with a sinusoidal input [[signal (information theory)|signal]]. When other frequencies are present, the term ''&quot;amplitude&quot;'' refers to that of the fundamental only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1650">In electrical engineering and acoustics, '''immittance''' is a concept combining the [[Electrical impedance|'''im'''pedance]] and [[admittance|ad'''mittance''']] of a system or circuit. The term ''immittance'' was invented by [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last= Bode

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes convenient to use ''immittance'' to refer to a [[complex number]] which may be either the impedance (ratio of [[volt]]age to [[Electric current|current]] in electrical circuits, or [[sound pressure]] to [[volume velocity]] in acoustical systems) or the admittance (ratio of current to voltage, or volume velocity to sound pressure) of a system. In [[audiology]], [[tympanometry]] is sometimes called ''immittance testing''.

Immittance does not have units since it applies to both impedance and admittance, which have different units. However, in certain theoretical work it may be necessary to deal with general functions, which afterward will be specialised to become either an impedance or an admittance by the assignment of suitable units; in such cases it is convenient to refer to the functions as immittances.

In electronics, the &quot;immittance&quot; [[Smith chart]] simply has both the impedance and admittance grids on the same chart, which is useful for cascading series-connected with parallel-connected circuits.

== History ==
InChroSil and its systems were invented and patented in 2006 by two brothers and one Sister (Silvia, Carlos and Jose Daniel Llopis Llopis) in your house and few economics resources. The first prototype was a single [[nucleotide]] pair and had a size of a sheet of paper. Today, it has developed and improved the [[integrated circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wylie|first=Andrew|title=The first integrated circuits|url=http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~wylie/ICs/ICs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tooley|first=Mike|title=Electronic Circuits - Fundamentals &amp; Applications: Fundamentals and Applications|isbn=978-0750669238|pages=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This configuration is now commonly referred to as a [[hybrid integrated circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert L. Boylestad|first=Louis Nashelsky|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=0135026490|pages=894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar &amp; Jain, Balbir Kumar, Shail B.

Currently prototypes are being built in the [[clean room]] of Microsystems Technology Laboratories [http://www-mtl.mit.edu/ '''MTL'''] of Massachusetts Institute of Technology [[MIT]] and staff [http://www.threellop.com '''Threellop Nanotechnology Inc'''] (owner of industrial property (patent)).

Current systems have a problem with the amount of information storage that organizations and institutions require. I.e. the human genome has approximately 3,000 million pairs of nucleotides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saenger | first = Wolfram | title = Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-387-90762-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alberts&gt;{{cite book |last=Alberts |first=Bruce | coauthors=Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts and Peter Walters |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell; Fourth Edition |publisher=Garland Science|year=2002 |location=New York and London |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=mboc4.TOC&amp;depth=2 |isbn=0-8153-3218-1 |oclc=145080076 48122761 57023651 69932405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book | author=Butler, John M. | year=2001 | title=Forensic DNA Typing | publisher= Elsevier | isbn=978-0-12-147951-0 | oclc=223032110 45406517}} pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and is divided into 23 [[chromosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alberts, Bruce, and Stillman|title=DNA &amp; Chromosome|journal=Abstracts of Papers Presented at the LVIII Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology, 2-9|date=June 1993|volume=Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology, volume 58, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1993).}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is too big for available systems, so currently only the principal chain is stored, meaning that holes within the [[DNA]] are not represented.  ''I''n''C''hro''S''il, offers less space and more information, with higher performance. It can store the entire structure of the [[DNA]] (principal and secondary chains), meaning ''I''n''C''hro''S''il can store and represent even incomplete chains including the existent holes within the [[DNA]] chain.

This device uses non‐volatile digital memory, less storage space, is portable and allows for rewriting. It is also able to store non‐genetic information in the nucleotides (the basic elements of the [[DNA]] strand). The nucleotides can be used to represent genetic information, text, files, or even pictures in a more compact manner and with a wide range of device, hardware and software compatibility.

== Adleman's experiment ==

The llopis siblings rebuild Adleman's experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leonard M. Adleman|title=Molecular Computation of solutions to combinational problems|publisher=Science, New Series, Vol. 266, No 5187, (Nov 11, 1994), 1021-1024}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hamiltonian path]] - [[Leonard Adleman]]) with inorganic materials (electronic components). From 90's, there are a lot experiment and projects about [[DNA computing]], but all these projects use organic materials and chemistry reaction to compute several problems, but this material dies over time, because it's organic and perishable and it don't work at industrial environments. By this reason, the llopis siblings created an electronic circuit or device to solve complex problem with all theories of [[DNA computing]].

== Uses for Inchrosil ==

Inchrosil is used mostly for mass storage sequences [[DNA]], with their uses:
* Fingerprinting staff, with the storage of the  [[genetic fingerprint]]. His invention is Dr. Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys A.J., Wilson V., Thein S.W. (1984). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v314/n6006/abs/314067a0.html &quot;Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA&quot;]. Nature 314: 67–73. {{doi|10.1038/314067a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Genetic studies, with the tool where large sequences would be stored, which could be compared and manipulated digitally.
* Genebanks, which store large amounts of genetic information.
* Classification of species and animals.
* Tool medical studies (genetic).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1242">Flexible circuits (also variously referred to around the globe as flex [[Electronic circuit|circuits]], flexible [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]], flex print, flexi-circuits) are members of [[Electronics|electronic]] and interconnection family consisting of a thin insulating [[polymer]] film having conductive circuit patterns affixed thereto and typically supplied with a thin polymer coating to protect the conductor circuits. The technology has been used for interconnecting electronic devices since the 1950s in one form or another and is presently one  of the most important interconnection technologies in use for the manufacture of many of today's most advanced electronic products.

In practice there are many different kinds of flexible circuits, including one metal layer, double sided, multlayer and rigid flex circuits. The circuits can be formed by etching metal foil cladding (normally of copper) from polymer bases, plating metal or printing of conductive inks among other processes. Flexible circuits may or may not have components attached. When components are attached, they are considered by some in the industry to be flexible electronic assemblies (see flexible electronics)

In [[information theory]] and telecommunication engineering, the  '''signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio''' ('''SINR'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Haenggi2009&quot;/&gt;) (also known as the '''signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio''' (SNIR)&lt;ref name=&quot;franceschetti2007random&quot;/&gt;)  is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on [[channel capacity]] (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR is defined as the power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the [[Interference (communication)|interference]] power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the [[signal-to-interference ratio]] (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is used less often when developing [[mathematical models]] of wireless networks such as [[cellular networks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;andrews2010primer&quot;&gt;J. G. Andrews, R. K. Ganti, M. Haenggi, N. Jindal, and S. Weber. A primer on spatial modeling and analysis in wireless networks. ''Communications Magazine, IEEE'', 48(11):156--163, 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity and randomness of certain types of wireless networks and signal propagation has motivated the use of [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to model the SINR, particularly for cellular or mobile phone networks.

== Description ==

SINR is commonly used in [[wireless communication]] as a way to measure the quality of wireless connections. Typically, the energy of a signal fades with distance, which is referred to as a [[path loss]] in wireless networks. Conversely, in wired networks the existence of a wired path between the sender or transmitter and the receiver determines the correct reception of data. In a wireless network ones has to take other factors into account (e.g. the background noise, interfering strength of other simultaneous transmission). The concept of SINR attempts to create a representation of this aspect.

== Mathematical definition ==

The definition of SINR is usually defined for a particular receiver (or user). In particular, for a receiver located at some point ''x'' in space (usually, on the plane), then its corresponding SINR given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x) {{=}} \frac{P}{I+N} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the power of the incoming signal of interest, ''I'' is the interference power of the other (interfering) signals in the network, and ''N'' is some noise term, which may be a constant or random. Like other ratios in electronic engineering and related fields, the SINR is often expressed in [[decibel]]s or dB.

==Propagation model==
To develop a mathematical model for estimating the SINR, a suitable [[mathematical model]] is needed to represent the propagation of the incoming signal and the interfering signals. A common model approach is to assume the [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks#Model fundamentals#Propagation model|propagation model]] consists of a random component and non-random (or deterministic) component.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB1&quot;&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume I --- Theory'', volume 3, No 3--4 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB2&quot;&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II --- Applications'', volume 4, No 1--2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterministic component seeks to capture how a signal decays or attenuates as it travels a medium such as air, which is done by introducing a path-loss or attenuation function. A common choice for the path-loss function is a simple power-law. For example, if a signal travels from point ''x'' to point ''y'',  then it decays by a factor given by the path-loss function

:&lt;math&gt;  \ell(|x-y|)=  |x-y|^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

where the path-loss exponent '' α&gt;2'', and ''|x-y|'' denotes the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between point ''y'' of the user and the signal source at point ''x''. Although this model suffers from a singularity (when ''x=y''), its simple nature results in it often being used due to the relatively tractable models it gives.&lt;ref name=&quot;andrews2010primer&quot;/&gt; Exponential functions are sometimes used to model fast decaying signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haenggi2009&quot;&gt;M. Haenggi, J. Andrews, F. Baccelli, O. Dousse, and M. Franceschetti. Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks. ''IEEE JSAC'', 27(7):1029--1046, september 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The random component of the model entails representing [[multipath fading]] of the signal, which is caused by  signals colliding with and reflecting off various obstacles such as buildings. This is incorporated into the model by introducing a [[random variable]] with some [[probability distribution]]. The probability distribution is chosen depending on the type of fading model and include [[Rayleigh distribution|Rayleigh]], [[Rician distribution|Rician]], [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal shadow]] (or shadowing), and [[Nakagami distribution|Nakagami]].

==SINR model==
The propagation model leads to a model for the SINR.&lt;ref name=&quot;franceschetti2007random&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB2&quot;/&gt; Consider a collection of 'n' base stations located at points ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the plane or 3D space. Then for a user located at, say ''x=0'', then the SINR for a signal coming from base station, say, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\ell(|x_i|)F_i}{\sum_j^n [\ell(|x_j|)F_j]-\ell(|x_i|)F_i +N} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are fading [[random variables]] of some distribution. The SINR is can be re-written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\ell(|x_i|)F_i}{\sum_{j\neq i} [\ell(|x_j|)F_j] +N} &lt;/math&gt;,
which under the simple power-law path-loss model becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{|x_i|^{\alpha}F_i}{\sum_{j\neq i} |x_j|^{\alpha}F_j +N} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Stochastic geometry models==
In wireless networks, the factors that contribute to the SINR are often random (or appear random) including the signal propagation and the positioning of network transmitters and receivers. Consequently, in recent years this has motivated research in developing tractable [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to estimate the SINR in wireless networks. The related field of [[continuum percolation theory]] has also been used to derive  bounds on the SINR in wireless networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;franceschetti2007random&quot;&gt;M. Franceschetti and R. Meester. ''Random networks for communication: from statistical physics to information systems'', volume 24. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;meester1996continuum&quot;&gt;R. Meester. ''Continuum percolation'', volume 119. Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coplanar waveguide''' is a type of electrical transmission line which can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. On a smaller scale, coplanar waveguide transmission lines are also built into [[monolithic microwave integrated circuit]]s. Conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) consists of a single conducting track printed onto a dielectric substrate, together with a pair of return conductors, one to either side of the track. All three conductors are on the same side of the substrate, and hence are ''coplanar''. The return conductors are separated from the central track by a small gap, which has an unvarying width along the length of the line. Away from the cental conductor, the return conductors usually extend to an indefinite but large distance, so that each is notionally a semi-infinite plane.

'''Conductor-backed coplanar waveguide''' (CBCPW) is a common variant which has a [[ground plane]] covering the entire back-face of the substrate. The ground-plane serves as a third return conductor.

The electromagnetic wave carried by a coplanar waveguide exists partly in the [[dielectric]] substrate, and partly in the air above it. In general, the [[dielectric constant]] of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence CPW will not support a true [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|TEM]] wave; at non-zero frequencies, both the [[electric field|E]] and [[magnetic field|H fields]] will have longitudinal components (a [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|hybrid mode]]).

In [[electrical engineering]], '''admittance''' is a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow a current to flow.  It is defined as the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. The [[SI]] unit of admittance is the [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol S). [[Oliver Heaviside]] coined the term ''admittance'' in December 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.155115|title=Immittance matching for multidimensional open-system photonic crystals|year=2003|last1=Ushida|first1=Jun|last2=Tokushima|first2=Masatoshi|last3=Shirane|first3=Masayuki|last4=Gomyo|first4=Akiko|last5=Yamada|first5=Hirohito|journal=Physical Review B|volume=68|issue=15|arxiv = cond-mat/0306260 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68o5115U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admittance is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Y \equiv \frac{1}{Z} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''Y'' is the admittance, measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]
:''Z'' is the impedance, measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]

The synonymous unit [[mho]], and the symbol ℧ (an upside-down uppercase omega Ω), are also in common use.

[[electrical resistance|Resistance]] is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as [[Electrical reactance|reactance]]). Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow, but also the dynamic effects of the material's susceptance to polarization:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = G + j B \,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the admittance, measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]], measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[susceptance]], measured in siemens.
*&lt;math&gt;j^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

==Conversion from impedance to admittance==
{{complex Z}}
The impedance, Z, is composed of real and imaginary parts,
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + jX \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''R'' is the resistance, measured in ohms
*''X'' is the reactance, measured in ohms

:&lt;math&gt;Y = Z^{-1}= \frac{1}{R + jX} = \left( \frac{1}{R^2 + X^2} \right) \left(R - jX\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Admittance, just like impedance, is a complex number, made up of a [[real number|real]] part (the conductance, ''G''), and an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part (the susceptance, ''B''), thus:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = G + jB \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' (conductance) and ''B'' (susceptance) are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  G &amp;= \Re(Y) =  \frac{R}{R^2 + X^2} \\
  B &amp;= \Im(Y) = -\frac{X}{R^2 + X^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude and phase of the admittance are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left | Y \right | &amp;= \sqrt{G^2 + B^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2 + X^2}} \\
            \angle Y &amp;= \arctan \left( \frac{B}{G} \right) = \arctan \left( -\frac{X}{R} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*''G'' is the conductance, measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]
*''B'' is the susceptance, also measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]

Note that (as shown above) the signs of reactances become reversed in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and inductive suceptance is negative.

In digital instrumentation system, especially in [[digital electronics]], digital computers have taken a major role in near every aspect of life in our modern world. Digital electronics is at the heart of computers, but there are lots of direct applications of digital electronics in our world.
All these digital electronics need data to be presented to them in a digital format (i.e. the data have to be digitally conditioned). This is called '''digital conditioning'''.
Since computers are [[electronics]] devices, all the information they work with has to be digitally formatted. Therefore, if they are used to control a variable such as [[temperature]], then the temperature has to be represented digitally. That's why we need digital signal conditioning to condition process-control signal to be an approximated digital format.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis D. Johnson, &quot;Process Control Instrumentation Technology&quot; Sep 6, 2006. ISBN 0-13-441305-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and digital fundamentals==
Digital [[signal conditioning]] in process control means finding a way to represent [[analog signal|analog]] process information in digital format.
.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Pallás-Areny, John G. Webster, &quot;Sensors and Signal Conditioning, 2nd Edition&quot;, November 2000. ISBN 978-0-471-33232-9&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of in control system is particularly valuable number of other reasons, however:
:&lt;math&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt; A computer can control [[multivibrator]] process-control system.
:&lt;math&gt;2.&lt;/math&gt; Nonlinearities in sensor output can be linearized by the computer.
:&lt;math&gt;3.&lt;/math&gt; Complicated control equation can be solved quickly and modified as needed.
:&lt;math&gt;4.&lt;/math&gt; [[Computer network|Networking]] of control computers allow a large process-control complex to operate in a fully integrated fashion.

==Digital information==
The use of digital techniques in process control system hat process variable measurements and control information be encoded into a digital form. Digital signals themselves are simply two-scale (binary)&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Graham C., Richard H. Middleton, and H. Vincent Poor. &quot;High-speed digital signal processing and control.&quot; Proceedings of the IEEE 80.2 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; These levels may be represented  in many ways. For example, two volts, two currents, two frequencies etc.

==Digital words==
Given the simple binary information that is carried by signal digital, it is clear that multiple signals must be used to describe analog information. Generally, this is done by using an assemblage of digital levels to construct a binary number, often called a ''word''. The individuals digital levels are referred to as ''bits'' of the word. Thus, for example, a 6-bit word consists of six independent digital levels, such as &lt;math&gt;101011_2&lt;/math&gt;, which cab=n be thought of as six-digit base 2 number. An important consideration, then, is how the analog information is encoded into this digital word.

==Digital whole numbers==
One of the most common scheme for encoding analog into s digital word is to use the straight counting of decimal (or base 10) and binary numbers representations.
 
==Some examples==
&lt;math&gt; Ex. 1.&lt;/math&gt; Find the base 10 equivalent of the binary whole number &lt;math&gt;00100111_2&lt;/math&gt; ?
Solution.
As in the base 10 system, zero preceding the first significant digit do not contribute. Thus, the binary number is actually 
&lt;math&gt;100111&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt;, decimal equivalent can be computed as follows:
&lt;math&gt; N_10 = a_5 2^5 + a_4 2^4 + . . . . + a_1 2^1 + a_0 2^0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; N_10 = (1)2^5 + (0)2^4+(0)2^3+(1)2^2+(1)2^1+(1)2^0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; N_10 = 32+4+2+1 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; N_10 = 39&lt;/math&gt;

'''Electrical resistivity''' (also known as '''resistivity''', '''specific electrical resistance''', or '''volume resistivity''') quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of [[electric current]]. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows the movement of [[electric charge]]. Resistivity is commonly represented by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ρ ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]). The [[SI]] unit of electrical resistivity is the [[ohm]]⋅[[metre]] (Ω⋅m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowrie |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h2-NjUg4RtEC&amp;pg=PA254 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-46595-3 |pages=254–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Narinder Kumar |title=Comprehensive Physics XII |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IryMtwHHngIC&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2003 |publisher=Laxmi Publications |isbn=978-81-7008-592-8 |pages=282–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Bogatin |title=Signal Integrity: Simplified |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_IiONSphoB4C&amp;pg=PA114 |year=2004 |publisher=Prentice Hall Professional |isbn=978-0-13-066946-9 |pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other units like [[ohm]]⋅[[centimetre]] (Ω⋅cm) are also in use.  As an example, if a {{nowrap|1 × 1 × 1}} m solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1&amp;nbsp;Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1&amp;nbsp;Ω⋅m.

'''Electrical conductivity''' or '''specific conductance''' is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity, and measures a material's ability to conduct an [[electric current]]. It is commonly represented by the Greek letter σ ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]), but κ ([[kappa]]) (especially in electrical engineering) or γ ([[gamma]]) are also occasionally used. Its SI unit is [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]] (S/m) and [[Electrostatic units|CGSE unit]] is reciprocal [[second]] (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Definition ==

=== Resistors or conductors with uniform cross-section ===
[[Image:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]
Many [[resistor]]s and [[electrical conductor|conductors]] have a uniform cross section with a uniform flow of electric current, and are made of one material. (See the diagram to the right.) In this case, the electrical resistivity ''ρ'' (Greek: [[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = R \frac{A}{\ell}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''R'' is the [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform specimen of the material (measured in [[ohm]]s, Ω)
:''&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;'' is the length of the piece of material (measured in [[metre]]s, m)
:''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the specimen (measured in square metres, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The reason resistivity is defined this way is that it makes resistivity an ''[[intrinsic property]]'', unlike resistance. All copper wires, irrespective of their shape and size, have approximately the same ''resistivity'', but a long, thin copper wire has a much larger ''resistance'' than a thick, short copper wire. Every material has its own characteristic resistivity – for example, rubber's resistivity is far larger than copper's.

In a [[hydraulic analogy]], passing current through a high-resistivity material is like pushing water through a pipe full of sand, while passing current through a low-resistivity material is like pushing water through an empty pipe. If the pipes are the same size and shape, the pipe full of sand has higher resistance to flow. But resistance is not ''solely'' determined by the presence or absence of sand; it also depends on the length and width of the pipe: short or wide pipes will have lower resistance than narrow or long pipes.

The above equation can be transposed to get '''Pouillet's law''' (named after [[Claude Pouillet]]):

:&lt;math&gt;R = \rho \frac{\ell}{A}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The resistance of a given material will increase with the length, but decrease with increasing cross-sectional area. From the above equations, resistivity has [[SI]] units of [[ohm]]⋅[[metre]]. Other units like ohm⋅cm or ohm⋅inch are also sometimes used.

The formula &lt;math&gt;R = \rho \ell / A&lt;/math&gt; can be used to intuitively understand the meaning of a resistivity value. For example, if &lt;math&gt;A=1\text{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell=1\text{m}&lt;/math&gt; (forming a cube with perfectly-conductive contacts on opposite faces), then the resistance of this element in ohms is numerically equal to the resistivity of the material it is made of in ohm-meters. Likewise, a 1 ohm⋅cm material would have a resistance of 1 ohm if contacted on opposite faces of a 1&amp;nbsp;cm×1&amp;nbsp;cm×1&amp;nbsp;cm cube.

Conductivity  ''σ'' (Greek: [[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is defined as the inverse of resistivity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conductivity has SI units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S/m).

=== General definition ===
The above definition was specific to resistors or conductors with a uniform cross-section, where current flows uniformly through them. A more basic and general definition starts from the fact that if there is [[electric field]] inside a material, it will cause [[electric current]] to flow. The electrical resistivity ''ρ'' is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the density of the current it creates:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{E}{J}, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''ρ'' is the resistivity of the conductor material (measured in ohm⋅metres, Ω⋅m),
:''E'' is the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the [[electric field]] (in [[volt]]s per [[metre]], V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
:''J'' is the magnitude of the [[current density]] (in [[ampere]]s per [[square metre]], A⋅m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;),

in which ''E'' and ''J'' are inside the conductor.

Conductivity is the inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{J}{E}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rubber is a material with large ''ρ'' and small ''σ'', because even a very large electric field in rubber will cause almost no current to flow through it. On the other hand, copper is a material with small ''ρ'' and large ''σ'', because even a small electric field pulls a lot of current through it.

==Causes of conductivity==

===Band theory simplified===

{{see also|Band theory}}
{{Band structure filling diagram}}

[[Quantum mechanics]] states that electrons in an atom cannot take on any arbitrary energy value. Rather, there are fixed energy levels which the electrons can occupy, and values in between these levels are impossible. When a large number of such allowed energy levels are spaced close together (in energy-space) i.e. have similar (minutely differing) energies then we can talk about these energy levels together as an &quot;energy band.&quot; There can be many such energy bands in a material, depending on the atomic number (number of electrons) and their distribution (besides external factors like environment modifying the energy bands).

The material's electrons seek to minimize the total energy in the material by going to low energy states, however the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] means that they cannot all go to the lowest state. The electrons instead &quot;fill up&quot; the band structure starting from the bottom. The characteristic energy level up to which the electrons have filled is called the [[Fermi level]]. The position of the Fermi level with respect to the band structure is very important for electrical conduction: only electrons in energy levels near the [[Fermi level]] are free to move around since the electrons can easily jump among the partially occupied states in that region. In contrast, the low energy states are rigidly filled with a fixed number of electrons at all times, and the high energy states are empty of electrons at all times.

In metals there are many energy levels near the Fermi level, meaning that there are many electrons available to move. This is what causes the high electronic conductivity in metals.

An important part of band theory is that there may be forbidden bands in energy: energy intervals which do not contain any energy levels. In insulators and semiconductors, the number of electrons happens to be just the right amount to fill a certain integer number of low energy bands, exactly to the boundary. In this case, the Fermi level falls within a band gap. Since there are no available states near the Fermi level, and the electrons are not freely movable, the electronic conductivity is very low.

===In metals===
A [[metal]] consists of a [[lattice]] of [[atom]]s, each with an outer shell of electrons which freely dissociate from their parent atoms and travel through the lattice. This is also known as a positive ionic lattice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20120416024619/http://ibchem.com/IB/ibnotes/brief/bon-sl.htm Bonding (sl)]. ibchem.com&lt;/ref&gt; This 'sea' of dissociable electrons allows the metal to conduct electric current. When an electrical potential difference (a [[voltage]]) is applied across the metal, the resulting [[electric field]] causes electrons to move from one end of the conductor to the other.

Near [[room temperature]]s, metals have resistance. The primary cause of this resistance is the thermal motion of ions. This acts to  scatter electrons (due to destructive interference of free electron waves on non-correlating potentials of ions) .{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Also contributing to resistance in metals with impurities are the resulting imperfections in the lattice. In pure metals this source is negligible .{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The larger the cross-sectional area of the conductor, the more electrons per unit length are available to carry the current. As a result, the resistance is lower in larger cross-section conductors. The number of scattering events encountered by an electron passing through a material is proportional to the length of the conductor. The longer the conductor, therefore, the higher the resistance. Different materials also affect the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Suresh V Vettoor [http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Sept2003/pdf/Sept2003p41-48.pdf Electrical Conduction and Superconductivity]. ias.ac.in. September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===In semiconductors and insulators===
{{main|Semiconductor|Insulator (electricity)}}
In metals, the [[Fermi level]] lies in the conduction band (see Band Theory, above) giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in [[semiconductors]] the position of the Fermi level is within the band gap, approximately half-way between the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum for intrinsic (undoped) semiconductors. This means that at 0 kelvin, there are no free conduction electrons and the resistance is infinite. However, the resistance will continue to decrease as the charge carrier density in the conduction band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, [[dopant]] atoms increase the majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction band or accepting holes in the valence band. For both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing the dopant density leads to a reduction in the resistance, hence highly doped semiconductors behave metallically. At very high temperatures, the contribution of thermally generated carriers will dominate over the contribution from dopant atoms and the resistance will decrease exponentially with temperature.

===In ionic liquids/electrolytes===
{{main|Conductivity (electrolytic)}}
In [[electrolyte]]s, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes, but by full atomic species ([[ion]]s) traveling, each carrying an electrical charge. The resistivity of ionic liquids varies tremendously by the concentration – while distilled water is almost an insulator, [[salt water]] is a very efficient electrical conductor. In [[cell membrane|biological membranes]], currents are carried by ionic salts. Small holes in the membranes, called [[ion channel]]s, are selective to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.

===Superconductivity===
{{main|Superconductivity}}
The electrical resistivity of a metallic [[electrical conductor|conductor]] decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], such as [[copper]] or [[silver]], this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near [[absolute zero]], a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An [[electric current]] flowing in a loop of [[superconducting wire]] can persist indefinitely with no power source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallop&quot;&gt;

In 1986, it was discovered that some [[cuprate]]-[[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] [[ceramic]] materials have a critical temperature above {{convert|90|K|°C|abbr=on|0}}. Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a [[conventional superconductor]], leading the materials to be termed [[high-temperature superconductors]]. [[Liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&amp;nbsp;K, facilitating many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures. In conventional superconductors, electrons are held together in pairs by an attraction mediated by lattice [[phonon]]s. The best available model of high-temperature superconductivity is still somewhat crude. There is a hypothesis that electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors is mediated by short-range spin waves known as paramagnons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Plasma===
{{main|Plasma}}
[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Lightning]]
is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface.
Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 Kelvin (27,726.85&amp;nbsp;°C) (49,940.33&amp;nbsp;°F) and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

Plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s and electric potentials play an important role.
The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the &quot;plasma potential&quot;, or the &quot;space potential&quot;. If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of &quot;quasineutrality&quot;, which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;Z&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases.&lt;ref&gt;Yaffa Eliezer, Shalom Eliezer, ''The Fourth State of Matter: An Introduction to the Physics of Plasma'', Publisher: Adam Hilger, 1989, ISBN 978-0-85274-164-1, 226 pages, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bittencourt, J.A.|title=Fundamentals of Plasma Physics|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780387209753|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qCA64ys-5bUC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from these and other lower-energy [[states of matter]]. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

! Electrical conductivity
| '''Very low''': Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/AliceHong.shtml|title=Dielectric Strength of Air|year=2000|first=Alice|last=Hong|work=The Physics Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| '''Usually very high''': For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite.
|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Resistivity of various materials==&lt;!-- [[Temperature coefficient]] links here --&gt;
{{Main|Electrical resistivities of the elements (data page)}}
* A [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as a [[metal]] has high conductivity and a low resistivity.
* An [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] like [[glass]] has low conductivity and a high resistivity.
* The conductivity of a [[semiconductor]] is generally intermediate, but varies widely under different conditions, such as exposure of the material to electric fields or specific frequencies of [[light]], and, most important, with [[temperature]] and composition of the semiconductor material.

The degree of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] in semiconductors makes a large difference in conductivity. To a point, more doping leads to higher conductivity. The conductivity of a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] of [[Water (molecule)|water]] is highly dependent on its [[concentration]] of dissolved [[salts]], and other chemical species that [[Ionization|ionize]] in the solution. Electrical conductivity of water samples is used as an indicator of how salt-free, ion-free, or impurity-free the sample is; the purer the water, the lower the conductivity (the higher the resistivity). Conductivity measurements in water are often reported as ''specific conductance'', relative to the conductivity of pure water at {{val|25|u=°C}}. An [[EC meter]] is normally used to measure conductivity in a solution. A rough summary is as follows:

The effective temperature coefficient varies with temperature and purity level of the material. The 20&amp;nbsp;°C value is only an approximation when used at other temperatures. For example, the coefficient becomes lower at higher temperatures for copper, and the value 0.00427 is commonly specified at {{val|0|u=°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.bldrdoc.gov/docs/nbshb100.pdf Copper Wire Tables]. US Dep. of Commerce. National Bureau of Standards Handbook. February 21, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremely low resistivity (high conductivity) of silver is characteristic of metals. [[George Gamow]] tidily summed up the nature of the metals' dealings with electrons in his science-popularizing book, ''One, Two, Three...Infinity'' (1947): &quot;The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.&quot; More technically, the [[free electron model]] gives a basic description of electron flow in metals.

Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least {{val|e=10}} worse insulator than oven-dry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmission Lines data&quot;/&gt; In any case, a sufficiently high voltage – such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension powerlines – can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood.

==Temperature dependence==

===Linear approximation===
The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature ''T'' does not vary too much, a [[linear approximation]] is typically used:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(T) = \rho_0[1+\alpha (T - T_0)]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''temperature coefficient of resistivity'', &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the resistivity at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; was measured at with a suffix, such as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{15}&lt;/math&gt;, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Ward (1971) ''Electrical Engineering Science'', pp. 36–40, McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the [[linear approximation]] is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.

===Metals===
In general, electrical resistivity of [[metal]]s increases with [[temperature]]. Electron–[[phonon]] interactions can play a key role. At high temperatures, the resistance of a metal increases linearly with temperature. As the temperature of a metal is reduced, the temperature dependence of resistivity follows a power law function of temperature. Mathematically the temperature dependence of the resistivity ρ of a metal is given by the Bloch–Grüneisen formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(T)=\rho(0)+A\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_R}\right)^n\int_0^{\frac{\Theta_R}{T}}\frac{x^n}{(e^x-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the residual resistivity due to defect scattering, A is a constant that depends on the velocity of electrons at the [[Fermi surface]], the [[Debye radius]] and the number density of electrons in the metal. &lt;math&gt;\Theta_R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Debye temperature]] as obtained from resistivity measurements and matches very closely with the values of Debye temperature obtained from specific heat measurements. n is an integer that depends upon the nature of interaction:

# n=5 implies that the resistance is due to scattering of electrons by [[phonon]]s (as it is for simple metals)
# n=3 implies that the resistance is due to s-d electron scattering (as is the case for transition metals)
# n=2 implies that the resistance is due to electron–electron interaction.

If more than one source of scattering is simultaneously present, Matthiessen's Rule
(first formulated by [[Augustus Matthiessen]] in the 1860s)
&lt;ref&gt;A. Matthiessen, Rep. Brit. Ass. 32, 144 (1862)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Matthiessen, Progg. Anallen, 122, 47 (1864)&lt;/ref&gt; says that the total resistance can be approximated by adding up several different terms, each with the appropriate value of ''n''.

As the temperature of the metal is sufficiently reduced (so as to 'freeze' all the phonons), the resistivity usually reaches a
constant value, known as the '''residual resistivity'''. This value depends not only on the type of metal, but on its purity and thermal history. The value of the residual resistivity of a metal is decided by its impurity concentration. Some materials lose all electrical resistivity at sufficiently low temperatures, due to an effect known as [[superconductivity]].

An investigation of the low-temperature resistivity of metals was the motivation to [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's]] experiments that led in 1911 to discovery of [[superconductivity]]. For details see [[History of superconductivity]].

===Semiconductors===
{{main|Semiconductor}}
In general, resistivity of [[intrinsic semiconductor]]s decreases with increasing temperature. The electrons are bumped to the [[conduction band|conduction energy band]] by thermal energy, where they flow freely and in doing so leave behind [[Electron hole|holes]] in the [[valence band]] which also flow freely. The electric resistance of a typical [[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]] (non doped) [[semiconductor]] decreases [[exponential decay|exponentially]] with the temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho= \rho_0 e^{-aT}\,&lt;/math&gt;

An even better approximation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a semiconductor is given by the [[Steinhart–Hart equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;1/T = A + B \ln(\rho) + C (\ln(\rho))^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are the so-called '''Steinhart–Hart coefficients'''.

This equation is used to calibrate [[thermistor]]s.

[[Extrinsic semiconductor|Extrinsic (doped) semiconductors]] have a far more complicated temperature profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors. After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers the resistance starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers (much as in a metal). At higher temperatures it will behave like intrinsic semiconductors as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant compared to the thermally generated carriers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seymour (1972)  ''Physical Electronics'', chapter 2, Pitman&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-crystalline semiconductors, conduction can occur by charges [[quantum tunnelling]] from one localised site to another. This is known as [[variable range hopping]] and has the characteristic form of
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = A\exp(T^{-1/n})&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, depending on the dimensionality of the system.

==Complex resistivity and conductivity==
When analyzing the response of materials to alternating [[electric field]]s, in applications such as [[electrical impedance tomography]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto H. Schmitt, University of Minnesota [http://web.archive.org/web/20101013215436/http://www.otto-schmitt.org/OttoPagesFinalForm/Sounds/Speeches/MutualImpedivity.htm Mutual Impedivity Spectrometry and the Feasibility of its Incorporation into Tissue-Diagnostic Anatomical Reconstruction and Multivariate Time-Coherent Physiological Measurements]. otto-schmitt.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to replace resistivity with a [[complex number|complex]] quantity called '''impeditivity''' (in analogy to [[electrical impedance]]). Impeditivity is the sum of a real component, the resistivity, and an imaginary component, the '''reactivity''' (in analogy to [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]). The magnitude of Impeditivity is the square root of sum of squares of magnitudes of resistivity and reactivity.

Conversely, in such cases the conductivity must be expressed as a [[complex number]] (or even as a matrix of complex numbers, in the case of [[anisotropic]] materials) called the ''[[Admittance|admittivity]]''. Admittivity is the sum of a real component called the conductivity and an imaginary component called the [[Susceptance|susceptivity]].

An alternative description of the response to alternating currents uses a real (but frequency-dependent) conductivity, along with a real [[permittivity]]. The larger the conductivity is, the more quickly the alternating-current signal is absorbed by the material (i.e., the more [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] the material is). For details, see [[Mathematical descriptions of opacity]].

==Tensor equations for anisotropic materials==
Some materials are [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]], meaning they have different properties in different directions. For example, a [[crystal]] of [[graphite]] consists microscopically of a stack of sheets, and current flows very easily through each sheet, but moves much less easily from one sheet to the next.&lt;ref name=Pierson/&gt;

For an anisotropic material, it is not generally valid to use the scalar equations
:&lt;math&gt; J = \sigma E \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E = \rho J . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the current may not flow in exactly the same direction as the electric field. Instead, the equations are generalized to the 3D tensor form&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Tyldesley (1975) ''An introduction to Tensor Analysis: For Engineers and Applied Scientists'', Longman, ISBN 0-582-44355-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Woan (2010) ''The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-57507-2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{J} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the conductivity ''σ'' and resistivity ''ρ'' are rank-2 [[tensor]]s (in other words, 3×3 matrices). The equations are compactly illustrated in component form (using [[index notation]] and the [[Einstein notation|summation convention]]):&lt;ref&gt;K.F. Riley, M.P. Hobson, S.J. Bence (2010) ''Mathematical methods for physics and engineering'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-86153-3&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; J_i = \sigma_{ij} E_j \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E_i = \rho_{ij} J_j . \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The ''σ'' and ''ρ'' tensors are inverses (in the sense of a [[Invertible matrix|matrix inverse]]). The individual components are not necessarily inverses; for example, ''σ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'' may not be equal to 1/''ρ&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Resistance versus resistivity in complicated geometries==
If the material's resistivity is known, calculating the resistance of something made from it may, in some cases, be much more complicated than the formula &lt;math&gt;R = \rho \ell /A &lt;/math&gt; above. One example is [[Spreading Resistance Profiling]], where the material is inhomogeneous (different resistivity in different places), and the exact paths of current flow are not obvious.

In cases like this, the formulas
:&lt;math&gt; J = \sigma E \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, E = \rho J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
need to be replaced with
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}) = \sigma(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}), \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where '''E''' and '''J''' are now [[vector field]]s. This equation, along with the [[continuity equation]] for '''J''' and the [[Poisson's equation]] for '''E''', form a set of  [[partial differential equation]]s. In special cases, an exact or approximate solution to these equations can be worked out by hand, but for very accurate answers in complex cases, computer methods like [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] may be required.

==Resistivity density products==
In some applications where the weight of an item is very important resistivity density products are more important than absolute low resistivity – it is often possible to make the conductor thicker to make up for a higher resistivity; and then a low resistivity density product material (or equivalently a high conductance to density ratio) is desirable. For example, for long distance [[overhead power line]]s, aluminium is frequently used rather than copper because it is lighter for the same conductance.

Silver, although it is the least resistive metal known, has a high density and does poorly by this measure. Calcium and the alkali metals have the best resistivity-density products, but are rarely used for conductors due to their high reactivity with water and oxygen. Aluminium is far more stable. Two other important attributes, price and toxicity, exclude the (otherwise) best choice: Beryllium. Thus, aluminium is usually the metal of choice when the weight of some required conduction (and/or the cost of conduction) is the driving consideration.

'''Timing margin''' is an [[electronics]] term that defines the difference between the actual change in a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] and the latest time at which the signal can change in order for an electronic [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] to function correctly.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} It is used in the design of [[digital electronics]].

[[Image:Timing diagram.png|Timing Margin Illustration]]

In this image, the lower signal is the clock and the upper signal is the data.  Data is recognized by the circuit at the positive edge of the clock.  There are 2x illustrated in this image.  One is the [[setup time]], and the other is the timing margin.  The setup time is illustrated in red in this image; the timing margin is illustrated in green.

The edges of the signals can shift around in a real-world electronic system for various reasons.  If the clock and the data signal are shifted relative to each other, this may increase or reduce the timing margin; as long as the data signal changes before the setup time is entered, the data will be interpreted correctly.  If you know from experience that the signals can shift relative to each other by as much as 2 microseconds, for instance, designing your system with at least 2 microseconds of timing margin will prevent incorrect interpretation of the data signal by the receiver.

If you change the physical design of your circuit, for example by giving more wire that the clock signal is transmitted on, the edge of the data signal will move closer to the positive edge of the clock signal, reducing the timing margin.  If you have designed your signals with enough timing margin, only the correct data will be received.

In electronics, '''direct coupling''' or '''DC coupling''' (also called '''conductive coupling''') is the transfer of electrical [[energy]] by means of physical contact via a conductive medium, in contrast to [[inductive coupling]] and [[capacitive coupling]]. It is a way of interconnecting two circuits such that, in addition to transferring the AC signal (or information), the first stage also provides [[DC bias]] to the next.  Thus, there is no need for a DC blocking capacitor to be used in order to interconnect the circuits. Conductive coupling passes the full spectrum of [[Frequency|frequencies]] including [[direct current]].

Such [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] may be achieved by a [[wire]], [[resistor]], or common [[terminal (electronics)|terminal]], such as a [[binding post]] or metallic [[chemical bond|bonding]]. 

==DC bias==
The provision of DC bias only occurs in a group of circuits that forms a single unit, such as an [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]. Here the internal units or portions of the op-amp (like the input stage, voltage gain stage, and output stage) will be direct coupled and will also be used to set up the bias conditions inside the op-amp (the input stage will also supply the input bias to the voltage gain stage, for example). However when two op-amps are directly coupled the first op-amp will not supply any bias to the next - any DC at its output will form the input for the next. The resulting output of the second op-amp now represents an offset error if it is not the intended one.

==Uses==
This technique is used by default in circuits like [[integrated circuit|IC]] [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]s, since large coupling [[capacitor]]s cannot be fabricated on-chip. That said, some discrete circuits (such as [[power amplifier]]s) also employ direct coupling to cut cost and improve low frequency performance.

==Offset error==
One advantage or disadvantage (depending on application) of direct coupling is that any DC at the input appears as a valid ''signal'' to the system, and so it will be transferred from the input to the output (or between two directly coupled circuits). If this is not a desired result, then the term used for the output signal is ''output offset error'', and the corresponding input signal is known as ''input offset error''. 

===Error correction===
Temperature drift and device mismatches are the major causes of offset errors, and circuits employing direct coupling often integrate offset nulling mechanisms. Some circuits (like power amplifiers) even use coupling capacitors&amp;mdash;except that these are present ''only'' at the input (and/or output) of the whole system but not between the individual circuit units inside the system.

==Advantages==
The advantage of direct coupling is very good low frequency response, often from DC (if the input/output coupling capacitors are not used) to the highest operating frequency that the system will allow. Most industrial applications that require monitoring of slowly changing signals (such as those from thermistors, thermocouples, etc.) must have a very good DC amplification with minimum offset errors and hence they have to be directly coupled throughout by default, and have offset correction or trimming incorporated into them.

A '''Dry cell''' is a type of [[chemical cell]]s, commonly used today, in the form of [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], for many electrical [[appliance]]s.  It was developed in 1887 by Yai Sakizō (屋井 先蔵) of Japan and patented in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baj.or.jp/e/knowledge/history01.html |work=The history of the battery | title = 1) The Yai dry-battery |publisher=Battery association of Japan |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dry cell uses a [[paste]] [[electrolyte]], with only enough [[moisture]] to allow current to flow. Unlike a [[wet cell]], a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid [[spillage]]. [[Lead–acid batteries|Lead-acid battery]] did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the [[gel battery]].

A common dry cell is the [[zinc–carbon battery]], sometimes called the dry [[Leclanché cell]], with a nominal voltage of 1.5 [[volt]]s, the same as the [[alkaline battery]] (since both use the same [[zinc]]–[[manganese dioxide]] combination).

A standard dry cell comprises a [[zinc]] [[anode]], usually in the form of a cylindrical [[pot]], with a [[carbon]] [[cathode]] in the form of a central [[rod]]. The [[electrolyte]] is [[ammonium chloride]] in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of [[ammonium chloride]] and [[manganese dioxide]], the latter acting as a [[depolariser]]. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by [[zinc chloride]].

==Types of dry cells==
*[[Primary cell]]s
**Zinc-carbon cells, also known as [[Leclanche cell]]s
**[[Alkaline cell]]s
**[[Lithium cell]]s
**[[Mercury cell]]s
**[[Silver oxide cell]]
*[[Secondary cell]]s
**[[Nickel-cadmium cell]]
**[[Lithium-ion cell]]
**[[Nickel metal-hydride cell]]

Primary cells are not [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]]. They have to be thrown away after their chemicals are used up.

Secondary cells are rechargeable. They can be used again.
