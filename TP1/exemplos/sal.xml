[[File:DeadSeaIsrael5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Salt deposits beside the [[Dead Sea]]]]
'''Salt''' is a mineral substance composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of [[Salt (chemistry)|ionic salts]]; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or [[halite]]. Salt is present in vast quantities in the [[sea]] where it is the main mineral constituent, with the open ocean having about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of solids per litre, a [[salinity]] of 3.5%. Salt is essential for [[animal]] life, and saltiness is one of the [[Basic tastes|basic human taste]]s. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues; therefore the typical diets of nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds require little or no added salt, whereas cereal-based diets require supplementation. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and [[Salting (food)|salting]] is an important method of [[food preservation]].

Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates back to around 6,000 years ago, when people living in Romania were boiling spring water to extract the salts; a saltworks in China has been found which dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and the Egyptians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara in camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations to go to war over salt and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is also used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.

Salt is produced from salt mines or by the evaporation of seawater or mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are [[caustic soda]] and [[chlorine]], and it is used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other products. Of the annual production of around two hundred million [[tonne]]s of salt, only about 6%  is used for human consumption; other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways and agricultural use.  Edible salt is sold in forms such as [[sea salt]] and table salt which usually contains an [[anti-caking agent]] and may be [[iodised salt|iodised]] to prevent [[iodine deficiency]].  As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods. Too much sodium in the diet raises [[Hypertension|blood pressure]] and may increase the risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and [[stroke]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium (5&amp;nbsp;grams of salt) per day.

==History==
{{Main|History of salt}}

[[File:Salzproduktion-Halle.jpg|thumb|Salt production in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] (1670)]]
While people have used [[canning]] and artificial [[refrigeration]] to preserve food for the last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years.{{sfn|Barber|1999|p=136}} A very ancient saltworks operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in [[Vânători-Neamţ|Lunca]], [[Neamț County]], Romania. Evidence indicates that [[Neolithic]] people of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Precucuteni Culture]] were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of [[briquetage]] to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC.{{sfn|Weller|Dumitroaia|2005}} The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began.{{sfn|Weller|Brigand|Nuninger|2008|pp=225-230}} The harvest of salt from the surface of [[Xiechi Lake]] near [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]] in [[Shanxi]], China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks.{{sfn|Kurlansky|2002|pp=18–19}}

There is more salt in animal tissues such as meat, blood and milk, than there is in plant tissues.&lt;ref name=HMSO/&gt; [[Nomad]]s who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |title=Salt (NaCl) |author=Wood, Frank Osborne  |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement, and the ancient Hebrews made a &quot;covenant of salt&quot; with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torahclass.com/archived-articles/1036-featured-article-sp-940659465 |title=Covenant of salt |author=Suitt, Chris |work=Rediscovering the Old Testament |publisher=Seed of Abraham Ministries |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient practice in time of war was [[salting the earth]]: scattering salt around in a defeated city in order to prevent plant growth. [[Abimelech]] was ordered by God to do this at [[Shechem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gevirtz, Stanley |year=1963 |title=Jericho and Shechem: A Religio-Literary Aspect of City Destruction |journal=Vetus Testamentum |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=52–62 |jstor=1516752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and various texts claim that the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] ploughed over and sowed the city of [[Carthage]] with salt after it was defeated in the [[Third Punic War]] (146 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ripley| first=George |last2=Dana |first2=Charles Anderson |title= The New American Cyclopædia: a Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge |volume=4 |page=497 |year= 1863 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=bK4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA497&amp;dq=carthage+sowing+salt&amp;q=carthage+sowing+salt#v=onepage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, salt was used as currency south of the Sahara, and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in [[Abyssinia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; Moorish merchants in the 6th century traded salt for gold, weight for weight. The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] have traditionally maintained routes across the [[Sahara]] especially for the transportation of salt by [[Azalai]] (salt caravans). The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to [[Bilma]], although much of the trade now takes place by truck. Each camel takes two bales of [[fodder]] and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/africa/tuareg_salt_caravans/ |title=Tuareg Salt Caravans of Niger, Africa |author=Paolinelli, Franco  |publisher=Bradshaw Foundation |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salzburg]], [[Hallstatt]], and [[Hallein]] lie within {{convert|17|km|abbr=on}} of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. [[Salzach]] literally means &quot;salt river&quot; and Salzburg &quot;salt castle&quot;, both taking their names from the [[German language|German]] word  {{lang|de|''Salz''}} meaning salt and Hallstatt was the site of the world's first [[Salt mining|salt mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210142713/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/billie/hallstatt/hallstatt.html |title=Hallstatt's White Gold: Salt |author= Billie Ann Lopez |work=Virtual Vienna Net |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town gave its name to the [[Hallstatt culture]] that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used [[pickaxe]]s and [[shovel]]s, began [[open pan salt making]]. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and [[Salt-cured meat|salted meat]] to [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] in exchange for wine and other luxuries.{{sfn|Barber|1999|p=136}} The word ''[[salary]]'' originates from {{lang-la|salarium}} which referred to the money paid to the [[Roman Army]]'s soldiers for the purchase of salt.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the following dictionary entries:

*{{OED|salt}}
*{{cite web|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition|publisher=Answers.com|url=http://www.answers.com/salary|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''salad'' literally means &quot;salted&quot;, and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting [[leaf vegetable]]s.{{sfn|Kurlansky|2002|pp=64}}

Wars have been fought over salt. [[Venice]] fought and won a war with [[Genoa]] over the product, and it played an important part in the [[American Revolution]]. Cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying [[Duty (economics)|duties]],&lt;ref name=Cowen/&gt; and towns like [[Liverpool]] flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/salt.htm |title=Salt |author=Smith, Mike |year=2003 |work=Goods &amp; Not So Goods: Lineside Industries  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples. The voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain, and the oppressive [[Gabelle|salt tax]] in France was one of the causes of the [[French Revolution]]. After being repealed, this tax was reimposed by [[Napoleon]] when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars, and was not finally abolished until 1945.&lt;ref name=Cowen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~gel115/salt.html |title=The Importance of Salt |author=Cowen, Richard |date=1 May 1999 |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] led at least 100,000 people on the &quot;Dandi March&quot; or &quot;[[Salt Satyagraha]]&quot;, in which protesters made their own salt from the sea thus defying [[British rule]] and avoiding paying the [[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax]]. This [[civil disobedience]] inspired millions of common people, and elevated the [[Indian independence movement]] from an elitist movement to a national struggle.{{sfn|Dalton|1996|p=72}}

{{main|Sodium chloride}}
Salt, sodium chloride, is an [[ionic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NaCl, representing equal proportions of [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The [[molar mass]] of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801&amp;nbsp;°C (1,474&amp;nbsp;°F) and its boiling point 1,465&amp;nbsp;°C (2,669&amp;nbsp;°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions and the solubility is 359 grams per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/519712/salt-NaCl |title=Salt (NaCl) |author=Wood, Frank Osborne; Ralston, Robert H. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the [[water of hydration|dihydrate]] NaCl·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the [[freezing point]] is −21.12&amp;nbsp;°C (−6.02&amp;nbsp;°F) for 23.31&amp;nbsp;wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7&amp;nbsp;°C (227.7&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=u1&gt;Elvers, B.

==Edible salt==
Salt is essential to the health of people and animals and is used universally as a seasoning. It is used in cooking, is added to manufactured foodstuffs and is often present on the table at mealtimes for individuals to sprinkle on their own food. Saltiness is one of the five basic taste sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/T/Taste.html |title=The sense of taste |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salt shaker on white background.jpg|thumb|Salt shaker for personal use]]
In many cuisines around the world, salt is used in cooking, and is often found in [[salt shaker]]s on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food.

===Fortified table salt===
Some table salt sold for consumption contain additives which address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. [[Iodine]] is an important micronutrient for humans, and a [[iodine deficiency|deficiency]] of the element can cause lowered production of [[thyroxine]] ([[hypothyroidism]]) and enlargement of the thyroid gland ([[endemic goitre]]) in adults or [[cretinism]] in children.{{sfn|Vaidya|Chakera|Pearce|2011}} [[Iodized salt]] has been used to correct these conditions since 1924{{sfn|Markel|1987}} and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of [[potassium iodide]], [[sodium iodide]] or [[sodium iodate]]. A small amount of [[dextrose]] may also be added to stabilize the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/food-safety/food-preservation/faq/canning-and-pickling-salt |title=Canning and Pickling salt |publisher=Penn State University}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/food-salt-faqs|publisher = Morton Salt |title=FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of [[mental retardation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcneil&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html |title=In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt|last=McNeil|first=Donald G. Jr|date=16 December 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iodized salt|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Uses-benefits/Salt-in-Food/Essential-nutrient/Iodized-salt|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommends [21 CFR 101.9 (c)(8)(iv)] 150 [[micrograms]] of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the iodine content of iodized salt is recommended to be 10–22 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion Paper on the setting of maximum and minimum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/supplements/documents/akj_en.pdf|publisher=Directorate-General Health &amp; Consumers |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium ferrocyanide]], also known as yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansard.millbanksystems.com&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|European Commission|2001|p=3}} Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morton Salt FAQ |url=http://www.mortonsalt.com/faqs/general-company-faqs#q3 |accessdate =12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the [[Committee on Toxicity]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansard.millbanksystems.com&quot;&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1993/may/05/table-salt Discussions of the safety of sodium hexaferrocyanate in table salt]. Hansard.millbanksystems.com (5 May 1993). Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other anticaking agents sometimes used include [[tricalcium phosphate]], [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or magnesium carbonates, [[fatty acid]] salts ([[acid salt]]s), [[magnesium oxide]], [[silicon dioxide]], [[calcium silicate]], sodium aluminosilicate and [[calcium aluminosilicate]]. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of [[aluminium]] in the latter two compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Wilella Daniels | last1=Burgess | first2=April C. | last2=Mason | url=http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/HE/HE-625.html | title=What Are All Those Chemicals in My Food? | publisher=School of Consumer and Family Sciences, Purdue University | accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;doubly fortified salt&quot;, both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates [[iron deficiency anaemia]], which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is [[Iron(II) fumarate|ferrous fumarate]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}} Another additive, especially important for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, is [[folic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), which gives the table salt a yellow color. Folic acid helps prevent [[neural tube defect]]s and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

A lack of [[fluorine]] in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of [[dental caries]].{{sfn|Selwitz|Ismail|Pitts|2007}} [[Fluoride]] salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where [[water fluoridation]] is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added [[sodium fluoride]].{{sfn|Westphal|Kristen|Wegener|Ambatiello|2010}}

===Other kinds===
[[File:Sea Salt.jpg|thumb|left|Irregular crystals of sea salt]]
Unrefined [[sea salt]] contains small amounts of [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]] [[halides]] and [[sulphate]]s, traces of [[algae|algal products]], salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt [[hygroscopic]] (i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered). Algal products contribute a mildly &quot;fishy&quot; or &quot;sea-air&quot; odour, the latter from [[Organobromine compound#Organobromine compounds in nature|organobromine compounds]]. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance. Since taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavours would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients.{{sfn|McGee|2004|p=642}} The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough [[iodine]] salts to prevent [[Iodine deficiency|iodine deficiency diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=References on food salt &amp; health issues|url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Articles-references/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-salt-issues/References-on-food-salt-health-issues|publisher=Salt Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different natural salts have different [[Minerality#I–P|mineralities]] depending on their source, giving each one a unique flavour. [[Fleur de sel]], a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a unique flavour varying with the region from which it is produced. In traditional [[Korean cuisine]], so-called &quot;[[Jukyeom|bamboo salt]]&quot; is prepared by roasting salt{{sfn|Livingston|2005|p=45}} in a [[bamboo]] container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the [[clastogen|anticlastogenic]] and [[mutagen|antimutagenic]] properties of [[doenjang]] (a fermented  bean paste).{{sfn|Shahidi|Shi|Ho|2005|p=575}}

[[Kosher salt]], though refined, contains no iodine and has a much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing [[kosher meat]]. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet [[kosher]] requirements by a [[hechsher]], but this is not true for all products labelled as kosher salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

===Salt in food===
Salt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing and is also present at higher levels in preserved foods. Thus [[herring]] contains 67&amp;nbsp;mg sodium per 100&amp;nbsp;g, while [[kipper]], its preserved form, contains 990&amp;nbsp;mg. Similarly, [[pork]] typically contains 63&amp;nbsp;mg while [[bacon]] contains 1480&amp;nbsp;mg, and [[potato]]es contain 7&amp;nbsp;mg but [[potato crisp]]s 800&amp;nbsp;mg per 100 g.&lt;ref name=HMSO/&gt; The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.&lt;ref name=HMSO&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual of Nutrition |last=Buss |first=David |last2=Robertson |first2=Jean |year=1973 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |isbn=0112411126 |pages=37–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2001/0729/taste.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=The Salt of Southeast Asia | accessdate=7 July 2011 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, condiments such as [[soy sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and [[oyster sauce]] tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diet.com/g/asian-diet |title=Asian diet |publisher=Diet.com |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cube-licking cow and calf.jpg|thumb|left|Cow and calf licking a mineral block]]
Only about 6% of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maldonsalt.co.uk/About-Salt-The-many-uses-of-Salt.html |title=The many uses of salt |publisher=Maldon Salt Company |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sodium chloride is one of the largest inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are [[caustic soda]] and [[chlorine]], which are separated by the [[electrolysis]] of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of [[PVC]], [[plastic]]s, [[paper pulp]] and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production of [[aluminium]]. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of [[soap]]s and [[glycerine]], where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the [[Saponification|saponified]] products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of [[synthetic rubber]], and another use is in the firing of [[pottery]], when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]].&lt;ref name=WASG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wasalt.com.au/SaltUses.html |title=Salt uses |publisher=WA Salt Group |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the boring mud to provide a stable &quot;wall&quot; to prevent the hole collapsing. There are many other processes in which salt is involved. These include its use as a [[mordant]] in [[textile]] dying, to regenerate [[resin]]s in water softening, for the [[tanning]] of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the [[canning]] of meat and vegetables.&lt;ref name=WASG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IHS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ihs.com/products/chemical/planning/ceh/sodium-chloride.aspx |title=Sodium chloride |date=1 December 2008 |publisher=IHS Chemical |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kostick|2011}}

The manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salt.org.il/arch.html | title=Salt made the world go round | work=Salt.org.il | date=1 September 1997 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of salt is seawater, which has a [[salinity]] of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of [[sea salt|dissolved salts]], predominantly [[sodium]] ({{chem|Na||+}}) and [[chloride]] ({{chem|Cl||-}}) [[ions]], per kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lbs) of water.{{sfn|Millero|Feistel|Wright|McDougall|2008}} The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated.&lt;ref name=IHS/&gt; The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. [[Salt evaporation pond]]s are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/earthobservatory/SALT_PONDS,SOUTH_SAN_FRANCISCO_BAY.HTM |title=Salt Ponds, South San Francisco Bay |work=Earth Observatory Newsroom |publisher=NASA |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either [[salt mine|mined]] directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in [[Open pan salt making|shallow open pans]] which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under [[vacuum]].{{sfn|Kostick|2011}} The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are [[kiln]]-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090409144219/http://www.saltsense.co.uk/aboutsalt-prod02.htm About salt: Production]. The Salt Manufacturers Association&lt;/ref&gt; Some salt is produced using the [[Alberger process]], which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12642/Alberger-process |title=Alberger process |work=Manufacture of salt: Uses of artificial heat |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ayoreo people|Ayoreo]], an indigenous group from the Paraguayan [[Gran Chaco people|Chaco]], obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (''Maytenus vitis-idaea'') and other trees.{{sfn|Schmeda-Hirschmann|1994}}

One of the largest [[salt mining]] operations in the world is at the [[Khewra Salt Mine]] in Pakistan. The mine has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} of passages. The salt is dug out by the [[room and pillar]] method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of [[Himalayan salt]] is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Seattle Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Pennington |first=Matthew |title=Pakistan salt mined old-fashioned way mine|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002159747_saltmine25.html |accessdate=11 October 2013 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, total world production (of sodium chloride in general, not just table salt) was estimated at 210 million [[tonne]]s, the top five producers being the United States (40.3 million tonnes), China (32.9), Germany (17.7), India (14.5) and Canada (12.3).{{sfn|Feldman|2005}} During the period 2003 to 2008, global production of salt increased by 12% per year, and China took over as the largest producing nation as its chemical industry expanded.&lt;ref name=IHS/&gt; Food grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] (7% in Europe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eusalt.com/pages/salt-applications/food-animal.html | title=Food Grade Salt | publisher=European Salt Producers' Association | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of salt production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roskill.com/reports/salt | title=Roskill Information Services | publisher=Roskill.com | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in religion==

[[Image:Chalcanthite-cured.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The blue salt [[copper(II) sulfate]] in the form of the [[mineral]] [[chalcanthite]] ]]
In [[chemistry]], '''salts''' are [[ionic compound]]s that can result from the [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reaction of an [[acid]] and a [[Base (chemistry)|base]]. They are composed of related numbers of [[cation]]s (positively [[electric charge|charged]] ions) and [[anion]]s (negative ions) so that the product is electrically [[electric charge|neutral]] (without a net charge). These component ions can be [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] such as chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as [[organic chemistry|organic]] such as [[acetate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[monatomic ion]]s such as fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as [[polyatomic ion]]s such as [[sulfate]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).

There are several varieties of salts. Salts that [[hydrolyze]] to produce [[hydroxide]] ions when dissolved in [[water]] are ''[[basic salts]]'' and salts that hydrolyze to produce [[hydronium]] ions in water are ''acidic salts''. ''Neutral salts'' are those that are neither acid nor basic salts. [[Zwitterion]]s contain an anionic centre and a cationic centre in the same [[molecule]] but are not considered to be salts. Examples include [[amino acid]]s, many [[metabolite]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[proteins]].

Usually non-dissolved salts in [[standard temperature and pressure]] are in solid [[state of matter]], but there are exceptions (see [[Molten salt]]s and [[ionic liquid]]s).

[[Molten salt]]s and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s, as they are able to [[Electrical conductor|conduct electricity]]. As observed in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, in [[blood]], [[urine]], [[plant saps]] and [[mineral water]]s, mixtures of many different ions in solution usually do not form defined salts after evaporation of the water. Therefore, their salt content is given for the respective ions.

== Properties ==
=== Color ===
[[Image:Potassium-dichromate-sample.jpg|thumb|Potassium dichromate, a bright orange salt used as a pigment]]

Salts can appear to be clear and [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] ([[sodium chloride]]), [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], and even metallic and lustrous ([[pyrite|iron disulfide]]). In many cases the apparent [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] or [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] are only related to the difference in size of the individual [[monocrystal]]s. Since light reflects from the [[Crystallite|grain boundaries]] (boundaries between crystallites), larger [[crystal]]s tend to be transparent, while the [[polycrystalline]] aggregates look like white powders. 

Salts exist in many different [[color]]s, for example:
*yellow ([[sodium chromate]])
*orange ([[potassium dichromate]])
*red ([[potassium ferricyanide]])
*[[mauve]] ([[cobalt(II) chloride|cobalt chloride hexahydrate]])
*blue ([[copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] pentahydrate, [[Prussian blue|ferric hexacyanoferrate]])
*purple ([[potassium permanganate]])
*green ([[nickel(II) chloride|nickel chloride]] hexahydrate)
*colorless ([[sodium chloride]], [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulfate heptahydrate]])—may appear white when powdered or in small pieces

Most [[minerals]] and inorganic [[pigment]]s as well as many synthetic organic [[dye]]s are salts.  The color of the specific salt is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the d-orbital of transition elements.

=== Taste ===
Different salts can elicit all five [[basic taste]]s, e.g., salty ([[sodium chloride]]), sweet ([[lead diacetate]], which will cause [[lead poisoning]] if ingested), sour ([[potassium bitartrate]]), [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] ([[magnesium sulfate]]), and [[umami]] or savory ([[monosodium glutamate]]).

=== Odor ===
Salts of strong acids and strong bases (&quot;[[strong salts]]&quot;) are non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and odorless, whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases (&quot;[[weak salts]]&quot;) may smell after the [[conjugate acid]] (e.g., acetates like acetic acid ([[vinegar]]) and cyanides like [[hydrogen cyanide]] ([[almond]]s)) or the conjugate base (e.g., ammonium salts like [[ammonia]]) of the component ions. That slow, partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water, since [[hydrolysis]] is the other half of the [[reversible reaction]] equation of formation of [[weak salts]].

=== Solubility ===
{{see also|Solubility#Solubility of ionic compounds in water}}
Many ionic compounds can be [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] in water or other similar solvents. The exact combination of ions involved makes each compound have a unique solubility in any solvent. The solubility is dependent upon how well each ion interacts with the solvent, so there are certain patterns. For example, all salts of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and ammonium are soluble in water, as are all  [[nitrates]] and many [[sulfate]] salts except barium sulfate, calcium sulfate (sparingly soluble) and lead(2) sulfate. However, ions that bind tightly to each other and form highly stable lattices are less soluble, because it is harder for these structures to break apart for the compounds to dissolve. For example, most [[carbonate]] salts are not soluble in water, such as [[lead carbonate]] and [[barium carbonate]].
Soluble carbonate salts are:
[[sodium carbonate]], [[potassium carbonate]] and [[ammonium carbonate]].

=== Conductivity ===
Solid salts do not [[Electrical_conductivity|conduct]] [[electricity]]. However, liquid salts do. Moreover, solutions of salts also conduct electricity.

==  Nomenclature ==

The name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium'' or ''ammonium'') followed by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride'' or ''acetate''). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium salt'' or ''ammonium salt'') or by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride salt'' or ''acetate salt'').

Common salt-forming cations include:

* [[Ammonium]] NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Calcium]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Iron]] Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Magnesium]] Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Potassium]] K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Pyridinium]] C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Quaternary ammonium cation|Quaternary ammonium]] NR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Sodium]] Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Common salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:

* [[Acetate]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[acetic acid]])
* [[Carbonate]] CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[carbonic acid]])
* [[Chloride]] Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[hydrochloric acid]])
* [[Citrate]] HOC(COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[citric acid]])
* [[Cyanide]] C≡N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[hydrocyanic acid]])
* [[Fluoride]] F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[hydrofluoric acid]])
* [[Nitrate]] NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nitric acid]])
* [[Nitrite]] NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nitrous acid]])
* [[Phosphate]] PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[phosphoric acid]])
* [[Sulfate]] SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[sulfuric acid]])

== Formation ==
[[Image:Lead(II) sulfate.jpg|thumb|Solid lead(II) sulfate (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Salts are formed by a [[chemical reaction]] between:

* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] → [[ammonium chloride|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]
* A [[metal]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[magnesium|Mg]] + [[sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* A metal and a non-metal, e.g., [[calcium|Ca]] + [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[Oxide|acid anhydride]], e.g., 2 [[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] + [[Dichlorine monoxide|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → 2 [[Sodium hypochlorite|NaClO]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]
* An [[acid]] and a [[Oxide|basic anhydride]], e.g., 2 [[nitric acid|HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sodium oxide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] → 2 [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]
* Salts can also form if solutions of different salts are mixed, their ions recombine, and the new salt is insoluble and precipitates (see: [[solubility equilibrium]]), for example:
*: Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2 NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)
